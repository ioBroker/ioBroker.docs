# How to add messages

## Adding messages
New news-messages must be added to the file 'news.json' located at ioBroker.doc/info. After testing the modified file, 
create a PR for the news to be published.

## Test messages
To test the messages, a link to a Json file can be stored at the state "readTestFile" of adapter ioBroker.info e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ioBrokerChecker/testData/master/testMessage.json. Consider using the changed news.json 
located at your fork for best test results. Note that a restart of info adapter might be necessary to pick up the new file.

## Required infos
- **title** - *required* Object in different languages (can be automatically translated from English with Gulp)
- **content** - *required* Object in different languages (can be automatically translated from English with Gulp)
- **id** - *required* If there are two identical IDs, ONLY the first message is displayed where the conditions apply.
- **created** - *required* Creation date in the format 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z

## Display options

- **date-end** - When should the message no longer be displayed (in format 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z)
- **node-version** - Can be used with bigger(x.x.x), smaller(x.x.x), equals(x.x.x) or between(x.x.x,y.y.y) to check the installed node version (since Info 1.5.1, Admin 3.6.7)
- **npm-version** - Can be used with bigger(x.x.x), smaller(x.x.x), equals(x.x.x) or between(x.x.x,y.y.y) to check the installed npm version (since Info 1.5.5, Admin 3.6.12)
- **os** - Can be 'aix', 'darwin', 'freebsd', 'linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', 'win32' and 'android' (since Info 1.5.5, Admin 3.6.10)
- **repo** - Can be 'latest' or 'default' (since Info 1.5.6, Admin 3.6.12)
- **uuid** - Sentry can help individual users with problems. For this it is now possible to enter the UUID as a condition. This can either be specified as a string, for example: "uuid": "6778667jkhhh7678zh" or as an array, for example: "uuid": ["jbiuh877h8g80ghoo", "huzhz87g887"]. The UUID is entered as hash sha256. Enter the following before the ID: "iobroker-uuid", followed directly by the ID. For hashing, e.g. this page can be used http://www.sha1-online.com/ (sinse Info 1.7.6, Admin 4.1.4) 
- **conditions** - Object in format ("adapter" : "condition") -> All conditions are linked with "and"
  - **installed** - Adapter is installed (example: "iot": "installed")
  - **!installed** - Adapter is not installed  (example: "cloud": "!installed")
  - **active** - Instance of adapter is active (sinse Info 1.7.1, Admin x.x.x)
  . **!active** - Adapter is installed, but there is no active instance of it (sinse Info 1.7.1, Admin x.x.x)
  - **bigger(x.x.x)** - Adapter version is bigger than (example: "admin": "bigger(2.2.2)")
  - **smaller(x.x.x)** - Adapter version is smaller than (example: "fronius": "smaller(1.2.2)")
  - **equals(x.x.x)** - Adapter has exactly the same version (example: "cloud": "equals(0.2.2)")
  - **between(x.x.x,y.y.y)** - The version of the adapter is between x and y or equal to x or y (example: "tankerkoenig": "between(1.0.5,2.0.4)")

```
Important!! New filter options should always be used with the following condition: "info": "bigger (x.x.y)" 
A version before the version of the publication so that it also applies - Why that? 
The display starts as true and goes through the conditions and may be set to false. 
Old versions do not know the filter and simply ignore it, so the message is then incorrectly displayed.
