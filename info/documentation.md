# How to add links

Each language has its own area in the list. The areas are divided into the following groups: community, documentation, development, blog, news, video and other.

For language-independent content, there is noLang at the bottom of the list.

Each group is an array of objects. Each object consists of title and link. The exception is the group news - there you have to specify a date in the format 2018-03-26T00:00:00.000Z.

In the noLang section, title is an object that can be written in different languages.
