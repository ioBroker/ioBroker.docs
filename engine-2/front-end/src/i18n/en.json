Although the project was originally designed to be language-neutral, over time it turned out that the German-speaking community became the most active—probably because ioBroker originated in Germany. Today, the ioBroker forum is the first place to go for questions, problem-solving, and exchanging ideas with other users. There you’ll find a wide range of tutorials, scripts, and best practices to help you get the most out of ioBroker. In addition to the forum, there is also a very active community on Facebook and Discord, where people discuss, help each other, and share new ideas every day. Whether you’re a beginner or an expert, you’ll always find support—and you can contribute your own knowledge to help others.",
