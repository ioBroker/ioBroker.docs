TR: This provides users with a convenient overview of their heat pump's status and the heating level in their home, facilitating easy monitoring and control of heating and hot water production.

TR: Here's how it works:

TR: The adapter fetches the list of systems and devices from the myUplink API at regular intervals (configurable by the user).

TR: For each device, the adapter retrieves the available parameters from myUplink and stores them in the object tree within ioBroker.

TR: If myUplink sends new parameters during this process, the adapter automatically incorporates them into the object tree.

TR: It's important to note:

TR: The adapter does not delete any objects, ensuring that data is retained even if myUplink does not send a parameter.
The adapter does not control which parameters are sent by myUplink; it simply retrieves and stores the data provided by the API.
