Dear ioBroker users, by popular request we have decided to publish the results of our developer meeting here on the blog. In the future we will create at least one new entry every month.

You can find the original meeting summary in german [here](https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/49502/meeting-f%C3%BCr-iobroker-core-dev-admin-15-12-21-20-30).

## Security on the net
First of all, we would like to comment on the Log4j topic - some users have expressed concerns about the security of the system. But you can all breathe a sigh of relief, because the security hole in Log4j only affects Java systems and ioBroker is based on JavaScript - both languages have nothing in common except the first 4 letters.

However, there is a problem that affects all of us. Not only ioBroker, but all systems worldwide - and that is port forwarding. It should be known, because we warn again and again that you should not use port forwarding to reach ioBroker or any system from the road. We are shocked to see that users use these systems quite openly in the network. Attackers can very easily find such systems and take control of home automation. Please use a secured VPN connection, SSL and secure passwords and if you are not 100% sure what to do, please use our [secure cloud solution](https://iobroker.pro/www/). This will save you from a rude awakening.

## Statistics
The number of recorded ioBroker [installations has increased worldwide](https://www.iobroker.net/#en/statistics) to about 62,000. Most of them are in German-speaking countries, but Russia and the Netherlands have also increased. There is still a lot of potential for translations, and anyone who has the time and inclination can help. Just go to https://weblate.iobroker.net/, create an account or log in via Github and start translating.

The update to Node.js 14 is progressing, but most users still use a version 12.x, which is not so bad, because this will be supported for some time. But if you have a version smaller than 12, then this should be updated soon, because the new JS controller 4, will no longer support older versions.

IoBroker now offers 443 different adapters, 363 of which are available in the stable branch. From the [wish list](https://github.com/ioBroker/AdapterRequests) of the community, 44 are in progress and will surely be ready soon. :grinning: All those who still have wishes are welcome to participate here, either by adding new wishes or voting for existing ones. Developers looking for a new challenge can then pick a project from the list.

On the popular social media ioBroker is also represented and the number of users is constantly increasing. Whether [Forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/440499112958264), [Discord](https://discord.gg/vmVYqPV) or Telegram, users can exchange ideas everywhere. New is our [Facebook International](https://www.facebook.com/groups/iobrokerinternational) page, for all English speaking users worldwide.

## Benchmarks
With the new benchmark adapter we tested some systems and these are the results:

This is a good help for all who are still looking for a suitable hardware for ioBroker. For the tests, common processes in the system were simulated and the average speed was determined. As you can easily see, the Intel processors are best suited to build very large systems. For the normal user, however, a Raspberry 3 or 4 is quite sufficient.

## JS-Controller 4.x (Preview)
We have had a first look at the new JS-Controller and there have been some improvements under the hood. First, support for Node.JS 10.x is discontinued, and users should update to a current version 14.x. Furthermore, a lot has been put into the optimization of the system, which will make the system faster in many cases. Security has also been taken care of, as passwords must now meet a certain complexity rule. It is planned to distribute the first test version by the beginning of January. If you want to have all the information and improvements in more detail, you can read all about it [here](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.js-controller/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Admin Adapter
There will be a few small enhancements to the Admin Adapter. First, starting with version 5.2.x with JS-Controller 4.x, you will be able to select multiple repositories at the same time and also licenses (VIS, KNX, LCN, IOT) will be fetched automatically from the network in the future.

## Docker Image
The new version of Docker Image with Node.JS 14 is available. Interested parties can get more information [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/buanet/iobroker/).

## Shelly Adapter
The popular [Shelly Adapter](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.shelly) is under further development and is available for testing in version 5. At least Node.JS 12 is required here.

## New adapters
A stable version of the new [Homekit Controller Adapter](https://github.com/Apollon77/ioBroker.homekit-controller) has been released. With this it is possible to control devices with the logo "works with HomeKit" directly via ioBroker. The adapter supports both WLAN and Bluetooth devices and can run completely on the local network (i.e. without cloud).

## Closing words
Before the Christmas days and the end of the year, our team would like to take the opportunity to thank you for the great cooperation this year! We wish all ioBroker users wonderful holidays and a happy new year! The next meeting will take place on January 19th. You can find more information (in german) [here](https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/50325/meeting-f%C3%BCr-iobroker-core-dev-admin-19-01-22-20-30)...
