# Roundup of new adapters and features between February and April 2024
This blog post provides a comprehensive overview of new adapters and features introduced in ioBroker between February and April 2024
It aims to deliver basic information for users of all technical backgrounds.

## New adapters 

### **senec** (25.2.2024)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nobl/ioBroker.senec/master/admin/senec.png" width="100" height="100" /> 

Connect your photovoltaic or power storage to ioBroker.
Initially targeted at the Senec Home V2.1 System. 

In the Senec.Home system, only selected values can be changed by the adapter. 

Senec currently also no longer provides a reliable way to influence peak shaving via the web interface. 
Whether other systems (e.g., V3) also work with it depends on whether they are also based on lala.cgi and provide the same JSON information.

### **energiefluss-erweitert** (11.3.2024)

This ioBroker adapter is the next Version of the "energiefluss" with the attribute 'erweitert' and allows to display an energy flow animation inside an iframe or HTML DIV.

This adapter visualizes energy flow for various elements like photovoltaics, battery, house-consumption, grid-feed-in (grid-consumption), car charge, etc.

Adapter provides an animated flow for all elements, you add.

Now you can see how your energy is moving at a glance.

### **nmea** (17.3.2024)
  
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.nmea/main/admin/nmea.png" width="100" height="100" />   

This adapter connects ioBroker to a yacht's NMEA-2000 bus, enabling access to data like speed, course,
GPS position, depth, wind, temperature, and even control of Raymarine autopilot systems.

Additionally, you can take data from non-NMEA 2000 devices and feed the data from them into the yacht bus for display on the vessel's standard displays.
There is also the option to play the anchor alarm, fire alarm, flood alarm via mobile phone or
remote monitoring of boat parameters when the boat has an internet connection (GSM modem, StarLink)

You can create a Telegram bot to request the information and control your yacht.

You can also create audio alerts for important events, such as when the water in the water tank runs out, 
and output these alerts either to the yacht's audio system or to a speaker connected to the raspberry Pi via USB or audio output. 

In vis-2 you can visualize data from NMEA 2000, but also data from any devices that are connected to iobroker.

You can select one ID more times to smooth it in different algorithms and/or times. 

The destination is an ID in the directory of the folder, which delivers you the smoothed values. 

You can limit the min- or max-values, the decimal places or ignore values with a high standard deviation.

### **heizoel24-mex** (14.4.2024)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ltspicer/ioBroker.heizoel24-mex/main/admin/heizoel24-mex.png" width="100" height="100" />

Monitor your heating oil levels with ease. 

This adapter retrieves data from the Heizoel24 server for MEX measuring devices, providing you with real-time insights into your heating oil status.

Simply enter the login data from your Heizoel24 account (e-mail and password). The MEX data is stored in the data point heizoel24-mex. 

The adapter starts by default every 3 hours. 
This is completely sufficient, as the MEX only sends data once a day. The data point CalculatedRemaining/JsonForEcharts (calculated remaining quantity) 
can be opened directly with eCharts.

### **vis-homekittiles** (25.3.2024)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//Standarduser/ioBroker.vis-homekittiles/main/admin/vis-homekittiles.png" width="100" height="100" /> 

Homekit Tiles is a widget set based on the design of Apple HomeKit.

The special feature of the widgets is that they do not contain any fixed style elements, but everything is formatted using CSS offering a high degree of flexibility.

As a result, there are no separate settings in the VIS editor for the position and/or size of the icons, labels, etc.
The design is adjusted by changing the CSS code.

For this purpose, the CSS code from the file `/widgets/homekittiles/css/style.css` can be used as a template.
The code is inserted into the CSS tab in the VIS editor and can be customized as desired.

It is also possible to add your own CSS classes via the VIS editor in the "General" section of the widgets.

The widgets are designed for VIS 1.x.

### **Admin** (06.4.2024)

The ioBroker Admin interface also received an update with the introduction of includes in JSONConfig files.

```
{
    "tabs": {
        "tab1": {
            "type": "panel", // data will be combined with the content of "tab1.json". If the same attribute is defined in both files, the value from the included file will be used.
            "#include": "tab1.json"
        }
    }
}
```
