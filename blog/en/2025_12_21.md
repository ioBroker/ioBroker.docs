## Adapter Updates and Features
### IoBroker.ping – new feature: TCP port check
<img width="100" height="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.ping/master/admin/ping.png?raw=true" />

The popular **ioBroker.ping** adapter has been enhanced and can now check **TCP ports** in addition to classic ICMP pings.

This allows you to determine not only whether a device is reachable, but also whether a specific **service** is running on the target system – for example, a web server, an MQTT broker, or an SSH service.

#### What is the benefit of TCP port checking?
With this new feature, the adapter can now:

- Check if a specific port is **open** or **closed**
- To determine whether a service is **available** or **out of service**
- Make network-dependent automations more reliable
- Provides more precise status updates than a classic ping

Example: A host responds to ping, but port 1883 (MQTT) is closed → indication of a service problem.

#### Typical use cases:
- Check if the **ioBroker** port of a remote system is reachable
- Monitoring of web servers (port 80/443)
- Monitoring of SSH (Port 22)
- Availability checks for databases, gateways, smart home devices
- Triggering actions when services fail

#### Special features:
- Works in addition to the normal ping – both can be used simultaneously.
- Very low system load
- Simple configuration: Enter IP/hostname + port
- Ideal for home networks, servers, NAS and smart home infrastructures

- **Update of the adapter-core override library** to version 3.3.2 (Apollon77)
- **JavaScript password generation** integrated for encrypting vendor scripts (GermanBluefox)
- **Updates to the plugin and Sentry components** (Apollon77)

#### Improvements for developers:
In the background, there were numerous typing optimizations that are particularly interesting for adapter developers:

- New typings for **visIconSets**, **smartName**, **supportsLoadingMessage**, **docker-api**, **findForeignObject**,
- Extended typing for **vis/vis-2 widgets**
- Additional typing for **json** in `adminUI.tab`
- Typings for **UserCommon** regarding external authentication

#### Installation:
If you have any questions or problems, the developers are available as always in [forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/83149/js-controller-7.1-beta-test?_=1766247523761).
