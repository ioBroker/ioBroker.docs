If you are interested, you can check out [minukodu.de](https://minukodu.de/)'s website. It focuses on minuVis, a cloud-free visualization solution for smart homes that can be integrated with ioBroker.

### **ioBroker.kisshome-research**
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.kisshome-research/main/admin/kisshome-research.png" width="100" height="100" />

* Category: Research
* Developer: Bluefox
* Description: This special adapter was developed for the KISSHome research project and is not intended for general use. It enables the collection of data from real smart home environments to support the project.

The [KISSHome project](https://kisshome.de/) is a research study funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. It collects data from real smart home environments to identify anomalies in data traffic and to train an AI model that detects such anomalies. The aim is to develop an AI-supported security solution to protect private households from cyberattacks. The results of the project will be made available as an open source solution to enable broad access and improve IT security.

Requirements:

1. Registration on the [KISSHome website](https://kisshome-research.if-is.net/) and confirmation by email.
2. At least 3 smart home devices in the household.
3. A Fritz!Box as a router (the adapter does not work without a Fritz!Box).

Participation in the study will be rewarded with a â‚¬50 voucher, provided that data is provided from at least three devices over a period of six weeks. For non-ioBroker users, a Raspberry Pi 5 with pre-installed ioBroker is available to enable participation in the study. Please spread the word - perhaps your colleagues or friends are interested in participating in the study.

By the way: The Institute for Internet Security Gelsenkirchen was represented by three researchers at our user meeting. They had a stand and presented the project in person in a lecture. You can find further details and the documentation on [GitHub page of the adapter](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.kisshome-research?tab=readme-ov-file).

## New adapters in latest
