# IoBroker News – August & September 2024
Summer is over and we're heading into autumn with renewed vigor. Although things have traditionally been a bit quieter in recent months as many of the developers have been on well-deserved vacation, there have still been a few updates and new adapters that we would like to introduce to you.

## New adapters
### **e3oncan**
Developer: MyHomeMyData

The **e3oncan adapter** enables monitoring of the CAN bus communication of devices from the Viessmann E3 series (One Base). In mode `Collect`, data points are recorded as from the energy meters **E380CA** and **E3100CB**. In addition, the adapter offers the option of actively reading and writing data, which is known as `UDSonCAN`. This allows, for example, setpoints and schedules to be changed or new schedules to be added, e.g. for a hot water circulation pump.

**Important note:** This adapter is only supported on Linux systems.
More information on how it works and how to install it can be found in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MyHomeMyData/ioBroker.e3oncan).

### **egigeozone2**
Developer: obakuhl

The **egigeozone2 adapter** is used to integrate the Android app **EgiGeoZone** into ioBroker. The app enables geofencing, and the adapter receives events when the mobile device enters or leaves a defined area. This allows presence and absence detection to be efficiently automated.

**Configuration:** The URL must be defined in the **EgiGeoZone** app in the format `protokoll://adresse:port/person`. Detailed instructions can be found in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/obakuhl/ioBroker.egigeozone2).

### **extron**
Developer: Bannsaenger

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bannsaenger/ioBroker.extron/master/admin/extron.png" width="100" height="100" />

The **extron adapter** enables control of Extron audio and video products via the Simple Instruction Set (SIS) protocol. It offers comprehensive control options for selected Extron devices, including matrix switchers and streaming encoders. Please note that the selected device type cannot be changed after configuration.

Supported devices include the **DTP2 CrossPoint 82** and the **SMD 202**. A free license is available for private users and non-profit organizations. For more information, see [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bannsaenger/ioBroker.extron).

### **gotify-ws**
Developer: Simatec

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simatec/ioBroker.gotify-ws/master/admin/gotify-ws.png" width="100" height="100" />

[https://github.com/simatec/ioBroker.gotify-ws](https://github.com/simatec/ioBroker.gotify-ws)

With the **gotify-ws adapter** you can establish a WebSocket connection to a Gotify server and receive all messages in ioBroker. Gotify is an increasingly popular notification service that is used in systems such as **Proxmox**, among others. With this adapter, messages can be forwarded to notification services such as **Telegram**, **Signal**, **Whatsapp** and many more.

The configuration is simple: You create a new client on your Gotify server and insert the generated token into the adapter configuration. The adapter can then receive all messages from the server. Further details can be found in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/simatec/ioBroker.gotify-ws).

### **rainbird**
Developers: Marius Burkard and iobroker-community-adapters

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.rainbird/master/admin/rainbird.png" width="100" height="100" />

[https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.rainbird](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.rainbird)

The **rainbird adapter** allows you to integrate a Rain Bird irrigation system with a **LNK WiFi adapter** into ioBroker. This project has no official connection to Rain Bird, but offers the possibility to control your irrigation system directly from ioBroker.

### **remeha-home**
Developer: Simatec

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simatec/ioBroker.remeha-home/master/admin/remeha-home.png" width=100 height=100 />

[https://github.com/simatec/ioBroker.remeha-home](https://github.com/simatec/ioBroker.remeha-home)

The Remeha Home Adapter enables the integration and control of Remeha heating systems via the Remeha Home platform. The adapter continuously connects to the API and enables the control of heating zones, setting the room temperature and activating the fireplace mode.

## New widgets
### **vis-2-widgets-rssfeed**
Developer: Oweitman

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oweitman/ioBroker.vis-2-widgets-rssfeed/main/admin/vis-2-widgets-rssfeed.png" width="100" height="100" />

[https://github.com/oweitman/ioBroker.vis-2-widgets-rssfeed](https://github.com/oweitman/ioBroker.vis-2-widgets-rssfeed)

There are now new **vis-2 widgets** for the **RSSFeed Adapter**. These allow you to display RSS feeds of various standards (RSS, Atom, RDF) in a user-defined layout. A flexible template system allows you to customize the feed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Important:** Due to errors in the automatic translation, only the English descriptions of the widgets are correct. For more information, see [GitHub repository](https://github.com/oweitman/ioBroker.vis-2-widgets-rssfeed).

### **Vis 2 (o)various widgets**
Developer: Oweitman

This adapter contains various vis-2 widgets, including a JSON template widget that can be used to display arbitrary JSON data points in the desired format. More widgets are on the roadmap.

### **vis-2-widgets-weather-and-heating**
Developer: rg-engineering

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rg-engineering/ioBroker.vis-2-widgets-weather-and-heating/master/admin/vis-2-widgets-weather-and-heating.png" width=100 height=100 />

[https://github.com/rg-engineering/ioBroker.vis-2-widgets-weather-and-heating](https://github.com/rg-engineering/ioBroker.vis-2-widgets-weather-and-heating)

This adapter contains vis-2 widgets for displaying weather forecast data from DasWetter.com or WeatherUnderground. Additionally, widgets are provided to support heating control.

## Further updates and features
