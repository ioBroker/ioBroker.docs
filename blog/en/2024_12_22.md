# Annual Review 2024 ‚ùÑ
Dear ioBroker community, the year is coming to an end and we would like to take this opportunity to thank you all from the bottom of our hearts.
Your ideas, your creativity and your enthusiasm for ioBroker are what have distinguished and driven this project forward for over 10 years.

Before we look at the challenges and opportunities ahead at the end of the year, we would like to look back together at the most important events and successes of this year.

The ioBroker platform currently has a total of 641 adapters.
In 2024, 26 new adapters were added, which corresponds to an average of one new adapter every two weeks.

## JS controller: the heart of ioBroker
In 2024, the js controller brought two major updates that stabilized the basis of ioBroker and expanded it with new features.
Version 6 in August and version 7 in November not only introduced numerous improvements, but also created new opportunities for developers and users.
We owe these innovations to Moritz (foxriver76), a member of the core team, who made a significant contribution to the further development of the controller through his tireless efforts.

Here is an overview:

### **New in js controller 6 (Kira)**
The version focused on automation, security and usability.

* **Automatic Adapter Upgrades** - The controller can now automatically upgrade adapters, saving time and ensuring systems always stay up to date.
* **System update notifications** (Linux-only) - When updates for operating system packages are available, the controller generates a corresponding notification.
* **Disk Space Warnings** - A warning is now issued when the system is running low on disk space. This allows timely intervention and prevents potential problems.
* **Ignore specific adapter versions** - Users can specifically ignore certain adapter versions - useful if a version causes problems.
* **Blocklist notifications** - If an adapter is blocked, the controller generates a notification so that users are immediately informed.
* **Redis TLS Configuration** - The TLS options for Redis can now be customized during the setup phase.

### **New in js controller 7 (Lucy)**
With version 7, the focus on dynamic interactions and usability was expanded:

* **Dynamic Notifications** - This new feature allows developers to generate notifications that users can interact with directly.
* Example: The ping adapter informs about new devices in the network, which can then be monitored directly.
* For developers, this feature is based on a JSON configuration that does not require in-depth frontend knowledge. Detailed documentation can be found in the Admin Adapter.
* **Docker Notifications** - Users of the official ioBroker Docker container now receive notifications as soon as a new version is available on Docker Hub. This keeps the system always up to date.
* **New backup technology** - The backup mechanism has been completely revised and now uses the JSONL format:
* Scalability: Even backups with millions of objects are possible without any problems.
* Backward compatibility: Older backups can be restored with the new js controller.
* Efficiency: Large installations benefit from significantly optimized creation and recovery processes.

## Progress in TypeScript: Future-proof development for ioBroker
In 2024, ioBroker took an important step towards modern software development: switching central adapters and components to TypeScript.

What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript that offers additional features such as type safety.
This means that developers can identify potential errors during development rather than only discovering them at runtime.
This upfront checking improves code quality, which ultimately ensures greater stability and reliability.
TypeScript also makes the code clearer and more maintainable - a decisive advantage when developing complex projects such as ioBroker.

For example, important components and adapters have been migrated to TypeScript:

* **JavaScript Adapter:** 50% of the work is already completed.
* **Admin Adapter:** The conversion has been fully completed.
* **VIS 2:** Also 100% completed, except for the widget adapter.
* **Js-controller:** 97% complete.

The switch to TypeScript secures the future of the project.

## Community, meetings and events
A special highlight this year was of course the user meeting for the 10th anniversary.
The feedback from the event was very well received and showed how much interest there is in further events.
We would like to include such events in our planning for the coming years - provided that our dedicated organizer Ingo (Apollon77) finds the time and energy to organize something like this again. üòä

The ioBroker community will remain a vibrant part of the platform in 2024 and will continue to be extremely active and helpful.
Whether on our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/HwUCwsH) with over 2,000 members or in the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/440499112958264) with now over 20,000 members or in the [Forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/category/4/deutsch), which has more than 30,000 registered users - we are happy when users share their ideas and projects with each other and support each other.

And... the ioBroker community doesn't just live online, it also meets locally.
As we learned on Facebook, meetings are also taking place in smaller groups - for example in Karlsruhe.
The next meeting there is already planned for January 16, 2025.
Details in this [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/440499112958264/permalink/2430520600622762/?rdid=zhb8LwR9ney1VfTU).
We think such initiatives from the community are great!

## What we wanted to say...
Recently, we have heard more and more voices expressing concerns about the future of ioBroker.
We would like to clearly dispel such fears. ioBroker is alive - and is continuously being developed.
The project stands on a stable foundation, supported by a passionate community and a group of dedicated developers who regularly deliver updates, new features and improvements.

Some of these unfounded fears may be based on the opinions of individuals who are making their views public.
Opinions can give a distorted picture, especially in online discussions or blogs.
It is therefore important to inform yourself, to think for yourself and not to blindly follow such opinions.

ioBroker is often compared to Home Assistant.
This is understandable, because both systems have their strengths and weaknesses - and both have their right to exist.
In terms of core functionality, however, both platforms offer the same thing - in the end it comes down to whether you prefer standardization (HA) or maximum customization (ioBroker), with all the advantages and disadvantages that these philosophies bring with them.
The choice depends on the personal requirements and technical skills of the user.

Home Assistant is supported by a large organization and has several full-time developers and professional marketing strategies.
We cannot achieve this speed and visibility as an open source project - and we don't have to.
We don't see ourselves as competitors to other systems, but as an independent platform with clear strengths.
Because ioBroker stands for maximum customization, a unique data point structure and the freedom to design your smart home the way that suits you best.
The strength of our system lies in its versatility and flexibility, and we are proud of that.

ioBroker is and will remain free - we are simply enthusiastic home automation enthusiasts.
But just to be clear: out of 78,000 users, only a small fraction buy licenses, while the majority use ioBroker completely free of charge.
More commitment - whether through purchasing a license, donations (also directly to the developers) or active participation - would help us achieve even more.
ioBroker is a German product, behind which stands a committed community that works on it with a lot of heart and passion.
It would be nice if we reminded people of this every now and then and perhaps showed a little more trust and solidarity to support a project like this - a product that is developed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts and has its roots here.

We stand firmly behind our platform and will continue to develop it with enthusiasm in the coming years.
Thank you for being part of this great community.
We look forward to creating another successful year for ioBroker together with you.

## Outlook for 2025
A key goal is the finalization of the Matter integration, which is already in the final phase.
We can look forward to what Ingo (Apollon77) will present to us shortly.

Another focus is on the switch to TypeScript. In particular, adapting the VIS 2 widgets to make them fully TypeScript compatible.

And otherwise... we'll just carry on and see what the next year, 2025, brings us.
The journey continues - full of opportunities, challenges and creative solutions.
As we all know, many ideas and projects are born in the process - and with fun and enjoyment in the process, one thing is certain: it will definitely not be boring!

Once again, a big thank you to the entire community, our developers and all supporters who make ioBroker what it is today.
Your commitment, creativity and contributions are the engine that has driven this project for over a decade.

Happy New Year to you all and a happy, automated new year!

Your ioBroker team üéÖ
