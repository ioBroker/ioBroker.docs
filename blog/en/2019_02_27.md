## NEW FORUM ONLINE
<!-- SOURCE: 840544 ## NEW FORUM ONLINE -->
Since 9.2.2019 the new forum is online. In the last few weeks since the changeover, we have discussed a lot with you about the forum, some settings, features and the structure, and have already worked together to optimize various things. Some topics are still in progress.
More than 11,000 users visit the forum daily and also discuss ioBroker in a new design and how they use ioBroker. For those who have not been there yet: once reset the password and off you go.
And a little tip: If the standard design is "too colorful" should look into the personal settings - there are several designs to choose from. JeyCee is also creating an ioBroker-owned theme.

All in all, we are very happy about the new features and possibilities. The available plugins and the fact that it is based on nodejs makes it easier for us to fix problems ourselves. As a result, the first PRs have been created in the nodebb GitHub repository.

## IOBROKER INSTALLATION FIXER
<!-- SOURCE: 81734 ## IOBROKER INSTALLATION FIXER -->
In the last newsletter, we introduced the new ioBroker installer for Linux-based systems. All new installations have a clean structure and do not run as root anymore.
How can you bring older installations to this level? How can you extend newer installations to the fixes the installer gets on a regular basis? We now have a solution thanks to AlCalzone.
The installer fixer is a script that runs and performs exactly that update - for all installations where ioBroker is installed in / opt / iobroker.

## DID YOU KNOW? WHY ARE PORT FREEDOMS BAD AND HOW TO MAKE IOBROKERS AFFORDABLE FROM EXTERNAL?
<!-- SOURCE: 460892 ## DID YOU KNOW? WHY ARE PORT FREEDOMS BAD AND HOW TO MAKE IOBROKERS AFFORDABLE FROM EXTERNAL? -->
Often it is sufficient that ioBroker is reachable in the home network, then everything is fine. No one comes from outside on the system. But what if you want to control your home while on the move? There are several options and you have to think carefully what you need. For simple queries and commands you can use Telegram, for example.
But if the visualization surfaces (Habpanel, Vis, Material or similar) should be accessible or even the admin web interface, then it will be interesting. In no case you should resort to port forwarding (not even if you "guesses anyway no" port numbers out)! Even SSL does not help here, because SSL only secures the data during transmission. Also, an activation of the authentication (user / password) only helps if you change the default password to something complex! And without being provided with the latest security updates regularly and in a timely manner, the use of SSL, username and password is dangerous.

The best option is to use the ioBroker cloud services. The Pro Cloud even allows access to the admin interface.

## IMPORTANT: TANKERKÖNIG V2.0.0-2.0.4 DEFECTIVE. PLEASE USE V2.0.5!
<!-- SOURCE: 654272 ## IMPORTANT: TANKERKÖNIG V2.0.0-2.0.4 DEFECTIVE. PLEASE USE V2.0.5! -->
In some recent versions of the Tankerkönig adapter, unfortunately, a mistake has crept in, which leads to many requests to the Tankerkönig server. This bug is not included in the 1.x versions and fixed in the latest repository from 2.0.5! So if you use Tankerkönig from the latest repository with a version 2.0.0-2.0.4, you should update URGENT to 2.0.5 or go back to a 1.x version. We have already communicated in the forum, but unfortunately not all users reached.
Although there was definitely no intent on the part of the developer to incorporate this error, it shows that there is some risk in using the Latest repository. Therefore, it is important to stay up-to-date in the forum or to check further updates (especially if you come quickly) and to install them promptly.
