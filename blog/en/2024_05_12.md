This ioBroker adapter is designed to interface with the Zendure Solarflow Cloud API, enabling users to retrieve comprehensive telemetry data from their Solarflow devices. 
Notably, this adapter provides access to data not visible in the official app, such as battery voltage. 

Users can also control their Solarflow HUB through the adapter, with most settings available for adjustment. 

Additionally, the adapter allows for the management of output limits, offering flexibility in implementing zero feed-in scenarios 
and enabling the creation of complex automation scenarios using a script or Blockly in ioBroker.

Features include the ability to halt input if a battery's voltage drops too low (battery protection), simultaneous control of multiple Solarflow devices,
and enhanced precision in calculations. 

Supported devices include HUB1200 (tested), HUB2000, and AIO (both untested).

### soliscloud (3.2.2024), developer: Trixx

### myuplink (18.2.2024)  Developer: sebilm Sebastian Haesselbarth
https://github.com/sebilm/ioBroker.myuplink

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebilm/ioBroker.myuplink/main/admin/myuplink.png" width="100" height="100" />

The ioBroker adapter for myUplink.com receives data from the myUplink API, specifically for Nibe Heat Pumps. 

This provides users with a convenient overview of their heat pump's status and the heating level in their home, 
facilitating easy monitoring and control of heating and hot water production.

Here's how it works:

The adapter fetches the list of systems and devices from the myUplink API at regular intervals (configurable by the user).

For each device, the adapter retrieves the available parameters from myUplink and stores them in the object tree within ioBroker.

If myUplink sends new parameters during this process, the adapter automatically incorporates them into the object tree.

It's important to note:

The adapter does not delete any objects, ensuring that data is retained even if myUplink does not send a parameter.
The adapter does not control which parameters are sent by myUplink; it simply retrieves and stores the data provided by the API.

### sun2000 (19.2.2024), developer: bolliy 

https://github.com/bolliy/ioBroker.sun2000

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bolliy/ioBroker.sun2000/main/admin/sun2000.png" width="100" height="100" />

This ioBroker adapter facilitates the reading and writing of register data from Huawei SUN2000 inverters and LUNA2000 batteries using Modbus TCP protocol. 

Additionally, it offers the capability to integrate third-party devices via the modbus proxy. 

Notably, even Huawei SmartLogger devices can be seamlessly integrated into the system using this adapter.
