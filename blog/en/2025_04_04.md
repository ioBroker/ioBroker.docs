# The next level of smart home: ioBroker now supports Matter!
Since the beginning of 2025, ioBroker has been taking the smart home to a new level: **The new Matter adapter is here!** After more than **two years of intensive development work**, ioBroker is now ready for the future-oriented smart home standard **Matter** – a quantum leap for everyone who wants to network devices across manufacturers and, above all, locally.

The lead behind this ambitious project is **Ingo (@Apollon77)**, who not only led the adapter development but also wrote his own open-source implementation of the Matter standard in JavaScript—independent of the official Matter SDK.

He was supported by Moritz (@foxriver76), Denis (@bluefox), and many dedicated testers from the community.

## What is Matter?
**Matter** is a cross-manufacturer smart home standard developed by the members of the **Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA)** – most notably Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung and many more.

Goal: Uniform, reliable and secure communication between smart home devices – **platform-independent and local**.

With **Matter**, devices from a wide range of manufacturers can be **seamlessly connected** – regardless of whether they're in Apple HomeKit, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa. The Matter standard even allows individual devices to be connected to multiple ecosystems, such as Apple Home and ioBroker, in parallel.

---

## What can the Matter adapter do?
With the new **ioBroker.matter adapter**, Matter can be fully integrated into ioBroker, both for controlling devices and for connecting to other platforms.

### 🔧 Features at a glance:
→ **Matter Controller**

- Integrate and control Matter-compatible devices directly in ioBroker – locally, quickly, without the cloud.

→ **Matter Bridge**

- ioBroker devices (e.g. Zigbee, Z-Wave, Shelly, etc.) other ecosystems such as Apple Home, Google Home or Alexa

as virtual Matter devices. This can also be done locally and without the cloud.

→ **Flexibility in communication**

- Supports various network types such as Thread, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE (BLE).
- Device linking via Admin or the Visu app.

→ **Multi-controller support**

- Multiple controllers can be used simultaneously – e.g. Apple Home, Google Home and ioBroker in parallel.

→ **Platform-independent architecture**

- Completely Node.js-based – no native compilation of C++ SDKs required.

## Technical feature: Own JavaScript Matter implementation
✨ An absolute highlight of the ioBroker implementation: **@Apollon77 has rewritten the Matter standard for Node.js** – completely in TypeScript/JavaScript, without using the official (and complex) Matter SDK in C++.

This decision brings many advantages:

✔️ Easier installation & maintenance

✔️ Better integration into the ioBroker ecosystem

✔️ Greater platform compatibility, especially on ARM devices such as the Raspberry Pi

✔️ More control and transparency for the developer community

#### This self-developed module is an outstanding technical achievement and underlines the innovative power of the ioBroker project.

## Requirements for the Matter adapter
For Matter to run stably in ioBroker, the following requirements should be met:

| Component | Prerequisite |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IPv6** | Must be enabled on the local network, and IPv6-relevant Linux kernel settings may need to be adjusted (especially when using Thread devices). |
| **js-controller** | from v5.0.19 |
| **Admin Adapter** | from version 7.4.x |
| **Docker users** | Host network mode or MacVLAN setup |

## Test now: Matter in the beta version
Version `0.4.15` is currently in **public beta** and is available in the beta repository.
The developers welcome any testers who provide feedback or help with troubleshooting!

---

## 🌍 Why Matter in ioBroker is a real game changer
With Matter, ioBroker becomes a **cross-platform control center** that:

✔️ Integrates Matter devices directly locally

✔️ ioBroker devices seamlessly integrated with Apple, Google & Co

✔️ can be used completely locally and without the cloud

✔️ relies on open standards and independence

This means maximum control, security and flexibility – exactly what power users and data protection conscious people need.

## A huge thank you to…
**@Apollon77 (Ingo)** – for developing the Matter adapter **and** the underlying Node.js Matter library **@foxriver76 (Moritz)** – for ioBroker Visu app integration, testing, optimizations, and feedback **@bluefox (Denis)** – for admin integration and UI support **…and to all testers** who report bugs, test devices, and advance development during the beta phase

*You make ioBroker future-proof!**

## Get started now – your smart home will be Matter-ready
With the new adapter you are ready for the next step in the smart home.

✔️ Install adapter

✔️ Pair devices

✔️ Start the future

💡 **Good to know:**

The Matter adapter can be used free of charge for up to 5 Matter devices – without registration or login.

Anyone who wants to integrate more than five Matter-enabled devices into ioBroker can activate this feature with the Smart Assistant license.
This keeps things simple and flexible, while power users can easily scale up as needed.
