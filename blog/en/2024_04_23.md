## Exciting **News** from Home Automation ESPHome (01.11.2023)

In a significant breakthrough for home automation enthusiasts, ESPHome documentation now officially acknowledges the integration of ioBroker with its native API. This development comes in the wake of a recent PR acceptance, positioning ioBroker alongside Home Assistant as one of the select home automation systems to leverage ESPHome's native API for direct client communication.

The native API, renowned for its highly optimized network protocol, presents a multitude of advantages over traditional MQTT methods, revolutionizing the way smart devices interact within the ecosystem. With this recognition, ESPHome underscores its dedication to providing efficient and robust communication channels for the smart home industry.

## Announcing the new **features** in ioBroker

### iobroker (11.10.2023) 
 Now, users can update their Node.js directly from the command line with the command:
`iob nodejs-update`

Visit the ioBroker forum for more details and discussion: 
https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/69067/neuer-befehl-iob-nodejs-update

To update to the suggested version (currently version 18), simply execute the command without additional parameters. 
Alternatively, specify a specific version by using the command
`iob nodejs-update 20`

### admin and mqtt (11.10.2023) 
The Admin and MQTT adapters now include a functionality to verify their accessibility from the public internet, particularly when no authentication is enabled. If reachable, both adapters will issue warnings in the log and within the admin interface.

This feature is invaluable as it addresses the security concerns associated with leaving the MQTT or admin adapter open to the internet without authentication. It serves as a safeguard, especially for users who may not be well-versed in securing their adapters.

### vis (06.11.2023) 
The license for vis has undergone a significant change to MIT. 
This adjustment means that you are now able to utilize vis free of charge in commercial projects, and no additional licensing is necessary.

### welcome (07.11.2023)
Now, users have the option to add custom links to the welcome page. 

These links will be dynamically checked to ensure their availability, providing users with convenient access to their desired destinations 
directly from the welcome page.
