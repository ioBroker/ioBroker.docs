The second edition of the Smart Living Forum took place in Solingen on June 14, 2025.
And as previously announced, ioBroker was once again actively involved this year.

Solingen, the city of blades, aims to establish itself as a modern smart city. The focus is on key topics such as mobility, energy and the environment, security and resilience, urban and spatial planning, and the responsible use of open data and municipal data.

The city relies on digital technologies that are used in a practical way and made directly accessible to citizens.

An overview of current projects and the digital urban development strategy is available on the official platform: https://solingen.digital

Our team was represented with its own information stand, a presentation, and a continuous presence in talks and discussions on the topics of Smart Home and Smart City.

In addition to ioBroker, other players in the smart home and digitalization scene also presented themselves with their own stands and contributions:

Solingen Digital â€“ municipal project for digital transformation

**There was always something going on at the ioBroker booth**

Despite the summer heat, which probably led to a few fewer visitors, the day was truly exciting and enjoyable for us.
The atmosphere was open and friendly. It wasn't just about technology, but also about ideas, experiences, and mutual exchange.

The "Glass Workshop" was technically well-equipped as a venue. For example, we had two large touchscreens on which we could demonstrate ioBroker live â€“ which was well received.

At our stand, we answered many questions, had exciting discussions, and were able to speak directly with interested visitors about their projects.

#### **Daily schedule and presentations**
After the official start in the morning with a welcome from Carsten Zimmermann (Department Manager) and an introduction by Nils Gerken (CDO of Solingen Digital), the event continued with exciting presentations.

The morning was dedicated to artificial intelligence and digitalization.
Prof. Dr. RenÃ© Frings from CBS University explained basic AI concepts and current developments.
Kai Kreuzer (Telekom AI Competence Center & openHAB Foundation) then spoke about how software is changing through AI and what this means for the smart home sector.

From 12:30 p.m. after the lunch break, the community projects took over:

**ioBroker Lecture â€“ Architecture, History, Ecosystem**

The ioBroker presentation was given by Denis Haev (bluefox) and Ingo Fischer (Apollon77) and was divided into two sections:

Part 1:
- Introduction to ioBroker and its architecture
- Review of the development history: From CCU.IO (2013) to the founding of ioBroker GmbH (2017)

up to current developments such as vis-2 (2022) and the 10th anniversary in 2024 and what ioBroker is today.

- The strengths of ioBroker. Among other things, logic (Scenes, Scheduler, Rules, Blockly, Node-RED and JavaScript, TypeScript), flexible object structure,

own Alexa skills, visualization options (vis-2, lovelace, HABPanel, iQontrol ...)

- Use in industrial processes (e.g. Audi, Villeroy & Boch, Hoyer)

Part 2:

In his talk, Ingo presented projects that emerged from the ioBroker ecosystem and are now used far beyond ioBroker.
These libraries are now also used in platforms such as Home Assistant, Node-RED, HomeBridge, and openHAB.
ioBroker is thus making a significant contribution to the further development of open source technologies in the smart home sector.

Another focus was the new Matter standard. Ingo explained the technical fundamentals and advantages:

- Cross-manufacturer interoperability
- Local communication without cloud constraints
- Secure, encrypted data transfer
- Multi-admin capability
- Certification and testing processes

He also discussed the requirements for Matter in the home network, such as the use of Thread, IPv6, MDNS, and UDP. He also demonstrated how alternative implementations such as matter.js complement the official C++ version and how these open source versions provide an accessible foundation, especially for developers.

Here, too, it becomes clear that open source means collaboration rather than competition.
Many of the tools presented benefit from mutual exchange between development teams, platforms, and projects â€“ this is precisely what makes such technologies sustainable.

A little extra at the end: Given the temperatures, the ice cream truck was just the thing.

#### **Finally**
The day was not only a platform for networking, but also an incentive to further develop ioBroker as a tool for creative, scalable and future-proof solutions.

Ingo also shared some insights in the forum:
