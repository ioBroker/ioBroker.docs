# RoundUp June 2024. New month, new ioBroker features!
In this blog post, we take a look at the new features, updates and news about ioBroker in June 2024: js-controller 6.0 in beta, new widgets, changes in admin 7.0, new adapters (waterkotte-easycon, hiob, notificationforandroidtv, gree-hvac), new app, new YouTube videos.

## News
### Release of beta version 6.0 of the js-controller for ioBroker
We announce the release of beta version **6.0.x of the js-controller** for ioBroker.

This version is based on the valuable feedback from our dedicated alpha testers and is now available in the official **beta repository**.

Foxriver76 has written a [Post in the forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/75206/beta-test-js-controller-kiera-v6-0) about this.

**Important changes:**

- Node.js requirements: Support for Node.js 14.x and 16.x has been discontinued.

We recommend switching to Node.js 20.x. Detailed **instructions for the update** can be found in [ioBroker Forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/64032/update-nodejs-best-practise-supported-14-16-und-18)!

- TypeScript and ESM: The controller code is now 90% written in TypeScript and fully implemented as an ESM module, providing increased technical flexibility.
- Feature removal: Support for binary states and Let's Encrypt has been removed.

These decisions were made to further improve the performance and security of the system.

- New features: New features include automated adapter upgrades and enhanced system management,

which are intended to simplify the handling and maintenance of ioBroker.

**Feedback and Support:**

As always, your **feedback** is **important** and crucial to the success of this version.
Please report any problems or discrepancies in the appropriate [Thread in the ioBroker Forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/75206/beta-test-js-controller-kiera-v6-0?_=1719625802080) so that we can react before the final release.

We would like to thank all developers and testers who contributed to this important release and appreciate their continued support and cooperation.

![widgets](en/blog/images/2024_06_29_jaeger_widgets.png)

In this video, Marc from YouTube channel [SmartHome leicht gemacht](https://www.youtube.com/@SmartHomeLeichtgemacht) shows how you can design the main page of the Smart Home interface more freely with ioBroker and JaegerDesign widgets and integrate RGBW lights.

**Summary of key points:**

**Free design of the main page:** It explains how you can freely design the main page using HTML widgets and CSS and also how you can place widgets, customize them and combine them with other elements.
An example is the creation of a widget with text and icon that shows the status of the windows in the house.

**Integrating RGBW lights:** It shows how to integrate RGBW lights such as Philips Hue lamps using the RGBW widget from JAEGER-Design.
It explains how to adjust the widget's settings, such as colors, brightness and white level.
One example is the integration of a Philips Hue lamp, which can be switched on and off with a switch on the surface and the color can be adjusted using an RGBW palette.

**Additional Tips:** Marc answers questions from previous videos, such as how to create curves.
He previews future videos where he shows how he designed his floor plan and how to integrate cameras and the alarm adapter.
