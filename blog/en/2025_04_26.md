Welcome to the current monthly review! A lot has happened in the ioBroker world again in April 2025.
New adapters have been released, existing ones have been improved, and the foundation of our system‚Äîthe js controller‚Äîhas received an update.
Let's take a detailed look at all the new features.

## Updates
### üíô **js-controller 7.0.7**
The js-controller is the heart of ioBroker.

It controls the entire runtime environment, manages adapters and processes, and ensures central communication within the system.

No ioBroker installation would function without it.

Version **7.0.7** introduces important improvements and bug fixes:

- Extended support for `encryptedNative` and `protectedNative`:

These fields can now also be used within complex structures and arrays, increasing data security and flexibility for developers.

- Optimized typing, which improves the development of new adapters and system stability.

### **ioBroker.devices 1.2.2**
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.devices/master/admin/devices.svg" width="100" height="100" />

**Developer:** bluefox

The devices adapter serves as the central management layer for devices in ioBroker.
It aggregates states, channels, and objects from different adapters (e.g., iot, material, matter) into logical devices and provides a unified API through which other adapters and scripts can access device data. This makes device organization more transparent and simplifies automation.

With version 1.2.2, the adapter has been comprehensively modernized: It has been converted to TypeScript and Vite, improving code quality, loading speed, and ease of development.

In addition, all known bugs have been fixed, noticeably increasing stability and reliability in daily use.
