**Category:** Weather

**Developer:** ticaki

The Brightsky adapter integrates the Bright Sky weather service into ioBroker.
The API provides weather data from the German Weather Service (DWD), prepared in an easy-to-use JSON format.

Special features:

- The data is updated every 30 minutes and always comes from the nearest DWD weather station.

- If a station does not provide any values, the adapter automatically resorts to the second nearest or further stations (fallback system).

- In addition to classic weather data such as temperature, precipitation, humidity and wind, the API also offers radiation values (solar), which are particularly interesting for PV operators.

- The API is freely accessible, does not require an API key and is completely open source.

### **ioBroker.energy-tracker**
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/energy-tracker/ioBroker.energy-tracker/main/admin/energy-tracker.png" width="100" height="100" />

**Category:** Energy Management

**Developer:** Energy Tracker

With this adapter, meter readings can be automatically transferred to the Energy Tracker platform.
This significantly simplifies the documentation of energy consumption or feed-in.

**Details from GitHub:**

- To use the app, you need to have an Energy Tracker account and create a Personal Access Token.
- Any ioBroker state can be defined as a source (e.g. electricity, gas or water meter).
- The values are transferred to the respective device IDs via the platform's public REST API.
- Values can optionally be rounded before they are sent.
- The adapter operates in schedule mode: a schedule must be defined in ioBroker to determine when data should be transferred. Without a schedule, no values are sent.
- The token is stored encrypted, communication is one-way ‚Äì only values are transferred to the platform, no data is read back.

**Category:** IoT Systems / Smart Home

**Developer:** Sickboy78

This adapter was specially developed for OnlyCat¬Æ cat flaps with prey detection. It allows you to control and analyze the flap directly in ioBroker‚Äîincluding the exciting feature that lets you know if your cat has just brought home any "presents." üê±

**Details from GitHub:**

- The adapter transmits cat flap events: entries and exits as well as prey detection.

- A device token from the OnlyCat app is stored in the settings.

- Transit policies can be set (controlling when cats are allowed in or out).

- The adapter also provides information about connectivity and firmware version.

- Starting with version 0.2.0, pet names are taken from the RFID profiles.

- Requires Node.js 20 or newer.

## New adapters in latest
These adapters are still in the testing phase. They are already available for testing. Community feedback, such as tests, reported issues, or suggestions for improvements, contributes significantly to improving their quality and stability.

### **ioBroker.smartloadmanager**
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quorle/ioBroker.smartloadmanager/main/admin/smartloadmanager.png" width="100" height="100" />

**Category:** Logic / Energy Management

**Developer:** quorle

The adapter is used to dynamically control loads based on PV surplus. The goal is to consume excess energy locally and, if possible, avoid or completely prevent feeding it into the public grid.

**Details from GitHub:**

- Supports both on/off switchable consumers and percentage controllable devices (e.g. heat pumps, chargers).

- Battery storage can also be integrated.

- Control is based on the current feed-in value; this allows consumers to be switched on automatically as soon as sufficient PV power is available.

- Flexible timeouts and schedules ensure that devices are not constantly turned on and off.

- In the current versions (0.0.7) bugs in the timeout functions were fixed and the configuration was improved.

**Category:** Visualization / Widgets

**Developer:** oweitman

This adapter allows you to display JSON data and other content in VIS or VIS 2. A flexible template system is available for this purpose, allowing you to freely combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Details from GitHub:**

- Originally the widget was part of rssfeed (vis1) and `vis-2-widgets-ovarious` ‚Äì now it is available as a standalone adapter.

- With the JSON Template Widget, any JSON objects can be visualized in freely designed layouts.

- Async calls with await are also supported, which enables complex data queries.

- There is no separate configuration dialog ‚Äì adjustments are made exclusively via the templates.

- After updates or installations, you may need to run iobroker upload jsontemplate to make new widgets visible in the VIS editor.

This makes the adapter suitable for users who want to create highly customized visualizations based on external data or complex JSON structures.

**Category:** Energy Management / Photovoltaics

**Developer:** Itspicer / Daniel Luginb√ºhl

The adapter reads data from the SofarCloud server and transfers it to ioBroker. SofarCloud is SofarSolar's official online platform, through which owners of Sofar inverters can monitor their PV systems. With the adapter, this data can now also be used in the smart home.

**Details from GitHub:**

- Login with email and password from the SofarCloud app required.
- The data points include, among other things, power, energy yields and status values of the inverters.
- Optionally, the data can also be forwarded to other systems via MQTT.
- Received values can also be saved as a JSON file (sofar_realtime.json).
- Security: Passwords are stored encrypted, after 3 failed logins the adapter stops automatically.
- Newer versions improve login handling, error handling and data quality (e.g. normalized values, more precise roles & types).
- This makes `sofarcloud` a practical link between Sofar cloud accounts and the smart home.

**Category:** Other / Cryptocurrencies

**Developer:** oelison / Christian Oelschlegel

This adapter allows you to integrate Monero mining data from P2Pool into ioBroker.
P2Pool is a decentralized mining pool that operates without a central operator and is managed directly between participants.

**Details from GitHub:**

- You simply deposit your public Monero mining address.

- The adapter then retrieves the mining results from the P2Pool website and provides them as data points in ioBroker.

- Typical values are hashrate, shares or mining yields.

- The current version 1.1.0 includes revisions to the process and the readme.

This allows mining setups to be directly monitored and integrated into automation ‚Äì for example, to log mining yields or optimize energy consumption.

### **ioBroker.nextcloudtalk**
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rello/ioBroker.nextcloudtalk/main/admin/nextcloud.png" width="100" height="100" />

**Category:** Messaging

**Developer:** Rello

The adapter integrates Nextcloud Talk into ioBroker. This allows messages to be sent directly from scripts or automations to talk rooms. A privacy-friendly alternative to commercial messaging apps.

A talk room is a chat or conference room within Nextcloud Talk where messages and conversations take place.

**Details from GitHub:**

- Configuration via the server URL, a username and an app token from Nextcloud.

- Messages are sent to a configured talk room (roomID).

- To send, it is sufficient to set the state text in the adapter - the content is then automatically posted as a message.

- Communication takes place via the official Nextcloud Talk API (/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v1/chat/{token}).

This allows system messages, alarms or status information to be conveniently distributed via Nextcloud.

### **ioBroker.xsense**
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arteck/ioBroker.xsense/main/admin/xsense.png" width="100" height="100" />

**Category:** IoT Systems / Security

**Developer:** arteck

The adapter integrates X-Sense devices (including smoke, CO, heat, and water detectors, as well as hygrometers) into ioBroker. Communication runs via the X-Sense cloud; an XSense Bridge SBS50 and an X-Sense account are required.

**Worth knowing:**

- Note on use: Frequent polling (default 5 min) actively wakes up the devices and can shorten battery life; the adapter is not intended as an alarm system, primarily for status/battery monitoring.

- Login limit: The app and third-party software cannot be logged in at the same time. We recommend using a second account to share the devices from the main account; these credentials are stored in the adapter.

- Python required: The adapter uses a Python environment (automatically on Linux/Docker; install Python on Windows and set the path if necessary). Troubleshooting information is documented in the Readme.

- Convenience: "forceRefresh" button for manual refresh; various fixes/improvements in the releases (e.g., roles, time state).

### **ioBroker.weathersense**
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ltspicer/ioBroker.weathersense/main/admin/weathersense.png" width="100" height="100" />

**Category:** Weather / Measuring Systems

**Developer:** Ltspicer / Daniel Luginb√ºhl

The adapter reads data from the WeatherSense Cloud, which is used by various Wi-Fi weather stations (e.g., models from `Ideoon`/`Pearl`). This allows measurements to be integrated directly into ioBroker.

**Details:**

- Log in with your WeatherSense account email and password.

- All measured values (temperature, humidity, air pressure, rain, wind, etc.) are stored in a central data point.

- The data can optionally also be forwarded to other systems via MQTT.

- Newer versions (3.0.x) have, among other things, protected password storage, improved data types and sorting, as well as additional sensor values (e.g. hPa).

This makes the adapter ideal for integrating inexpensive WiFi weather stations directly into the smart home.

**Category:** Hardware / Photovoltaics

**Developer:** mcm1957

The adapter integrates the Hoymiles Micro Storage Systems ‚Äì currently the MS-A2 model ‚Äì into ioBroker. These compact devices combine a microinverter with integrated battery storage and are specifically designed for balcony power plants and small PV systems. They allow excess energy to be stored and used at a later time in the home, rather than feeding it directly into the grid.

**Details from GitHub:**

- The adapter works as an MQTT server (client mode is planned but not yet implemented).

- Configuration via network address and port specified for the local MQTT service.

- Uses Sentry for automatic error detection (from js-controller 3.0).

- Documentation and setup instructions are available in German and English.

This allows owners of Hoymiles MS-A2 systems to integrate their storage solutions directly into their smart home ‚Äì for example, to monitor status and charging/discharging processes.

## New video on YouTube
<img src="de/blog/images/2025_09_06_Aliase_Kategorien_YouTube.png" width="400" />

In this video, we show you how to set up your ioBroker system sustainably and with low maintenance ‚Äì using aliases, categories, and virtual devices.
The goal: a stable structure that functions independently of the hardware used. This saves you a lot of time and effort in the event of a device change, as scripts and visualizations don't need to be adapted.

## Conclusion
With the end of summer, ioBroker has added a whole range of new adapters: from energy and weather services to communication, cat flaps and gaming.

A big thank you to all the developers who are driving these projects forward! If you're already testing the new adapters, please share your feedback in the forum or on GitHub so we can continue improving the quality together.

Until next month's review. Stay smart and curious!
