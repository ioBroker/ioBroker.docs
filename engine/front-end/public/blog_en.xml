            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>## JS Controller 4.0.24 and Node.js 18: An update is worth it\nThe latest version of the JS controller, version 4.0.24, improves compatibility with Node.js 18. It still prefers IPv4 addresses, which was changed in Node.js 18. Additionally, Node.js 18 becomes the recommended version as Node.js 14 and 16 reach end of life later this year. This is an important step to ensure the stability and security of your system.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>At the end of 2018 and especially in January 2019, @AlCalzone has completely overhauled the ioBroker installer, which means that in the meanwhile most current version from the beginning of February 2019 all rights issues are a thing of the past. ioBroker is no longer running as "root" but under its own user who can do whatever he needs for the current ioBroker adapters.\nEverything is fine for all new installations.</p>
