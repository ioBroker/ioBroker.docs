![测试和发布](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.matter/workflows/Test%20and%20Release/badge.svg) [![翻译状态](https://weblate.iobroker.net/widgets/adapters/-/matter/svg-badge.svg)](https://weblate.iobroker.net/engage/adapters/?utm_source=widget)

**此适配器使用 Sentry 库自动向开发人员报告异常和代码错误。**有关更多详细信息以及如何禁用错误报告的信息，请参阅[Sentry-Plugin 文档](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)！从 js-controller 3.0 开始使用 Sentry 报告。

＃＃ 介绍
> [!重要] > 该适配器无法通过 GitHub 安装：必须通过 ioBroker 存储库（稳定版或最新版本）安装。
> > ioBroker Matter 适配器的配置和使用详细说明请参阅 🇩🇪 [德语 Wiki](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.matter/wiki) 和🇬🇧 [英语 Wiki]](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.matter/wiki/Home-%E2%80%90-EN)。

＃＃ 描述
使用 ioBroker Matter Adapter，可以映射以下用例：

* 基于物质的设备可以直接链接到ioBroker，从而读取/控制
* 提供多个 ioBroker 设备作为 Matter Bridge：Matter Bridge 可以包含多个设备，是将 ioBroker 设备集成到 Matter 兼容生态系统的最简单方法。
* ioBroker 根据 ioBroker 设备/ioBroker 状态提供单独的虚拟 Matter 设备，这些设备可以教授给与 Matter 兼容的生态系统（目前仅适用于 Amazon Alexa 的桥接器）

## 待办事项

### 更新依赖项
更新项目依赖项时（在根目录`package.json` 和`src-admin/package.json` 中），请始终使用以下命令：

```bash
npm run npm
```

此命令更新主项目和管理前端中的依赖项，确保`package-lock.json` 文件正确同步。

### 运行测试
所有测试均使用 TypeScript 编写，无需编译即可直接执行：

```bash
npm test
```

测试位于`test/`目录中，并使用 ts-node 直接执行 TypeScript。
