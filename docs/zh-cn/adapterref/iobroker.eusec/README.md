# IoBroker.euSec
**测试：**![测试与发布](https://github.com/bropat/ioBroker.eusec/workflows/Test%20and%20Release/badge.svg)

这是一个用于与 Eufy 设备通信的[使用 [eufy-security-client](https://www.iobroker.net) 适配器的 ioBroker](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-client)库。

如果您欣赏我的工作和进步并且想要支持我，您可以在这里这样做：

[![ko-fi]（https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg）](https://ko-fi.com/E1E332Q6Z)

**本项目与 Anker 和 Eufy（Eufy Security）无关。这是一个业余时间维护的个人项目。**

＃＃ 描述
该适配器允许通过连接到 Eufy 云服务器和本地/远程站来控制[Eufy 安全设备](https://us.eufylife.com/collections/security)。

您需要提供您的云登录凭据。适配器连接到您的云帐户并通过 HTTPS 轮询所有设备数据。现在还支持与 Eufy 站/设备的本地或远程 P2P 连接。但是，连接到 Eufy Cloud 始终是先决条件。

一个适配器实例将显示来自一个 Eufy Cloud 帐户的所有设备并允许控制它们。

## 文档
查看文档[这里](https://bropat.github.io/ioBroker.eusec/)。

## 已知可工作的设备
关于支持的设备的信息可以在[这里](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-client#known-working-devices)中找到。

## 如何报告问题和功能请求
请使用 GitHub 问题来解决此问题。

最好将适配器设置为调试日志模式（参见[这里](https://bropat.github.io/ioBroker.eusec/#/debugging)）。然后请从磁盘获取日志文件（ioBroker 安装目录中的子目录“log”，而不是从管理员处获取，因为管理员会切断线路）。
