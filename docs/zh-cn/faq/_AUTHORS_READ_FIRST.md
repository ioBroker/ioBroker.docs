# Instructions how to fill FAQ

FAQ is a special folder. The content will be created automatically.

Please write every question in extra .md file and care about the order, by placing of number `000_` before the filename, like `010_how_to_update_nodejs.md`.

Write all the file names only in english. All files in one folder will be compiled together in one file and the user will see all questions from one folder on one page.

**Folders** must start with `_` and number. Like `_010_general`.

```
 - faq
   |- _010_error_finding
      |- media
          |- illustration.png
      |- README.md
      |- 010_how_to_enable_debug_of_adapter.md
      |- 020_how_to_check_iob_logs.md
      |- 030_how_to_check_browser_logs.md
   |- _020_adapters
      |- README.md
      |- 010_what_is_repository.md
      |- 020_how_to_change_repository.md
      |- 030_how_to_...
```

This will be compiled in 2 pages, where the header and the introduction will be taken from README.md following by the all questions.

It is not allowed to have more than 2 folder levels:

```
 - faq
   - 010_error_finding
      |- README.md
      |- 010_how_to_enable_debug_of_adapter.md
      |- 020_how_to_check_iob_logs.md
      |- 030_how_to_check_browser_logs.md
      |- 040_error_finding <-- invalid
          |- README.md  <-- invalid

```

The question/answer file looks like:

```
## Question
Answer.

```

The pictures can be placed in the same directory in folder `media`.

The links must be relative and think about, that all questions will be in the `faq` folder, so e.g. if you want to jump to `basics => adapter`, use
`[Adapter description](../basics/adapter.md)`
