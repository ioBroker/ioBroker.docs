# How to use images
After images have been downloaded from the download page, they are written to the SD card using an image tool (e.g. Balena-Etcher).

The further procedure for each individual image can be different.
This is why there is a **Info** button under each image on the download page.

If you click on this, the ReadMe belonging to this image appears.

The further procedure and safety instructions are stored there.

The current test image "2021-07-30-ioBrokerPi-lite.img" can be written to the SD card using the following commands under Unix:

** sudo umount / dev / sdx **

** sudo dd bs = 1M if = 2021-07-30-ioBrokerPi-lite.img of = / dev / sdx ***
