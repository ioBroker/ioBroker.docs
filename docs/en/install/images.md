# Procedure when using images
After downloading images on the download page, they are written to the SD card using an image tool (such as Balena-Etcher).

The further procedure for each individual image can be different.
Therefore the button **Info** is located under each image on the download page.

If you click on this, the ReadMe belonging to this image appears.

There the further procedure as well as safety instructions are deposited.
