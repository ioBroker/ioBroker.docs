## Proxmox - LXC (Linux Containers) -> Pass through USB devices
This part of the guide explains step by step how to pass through a USB device (USB passthrough) in Proxmox to an LXC (Linux container).

With a VM, it is possible to pass on a USB device directly via the Proxmox web interface. With a Linux container, the configuration file of the lxc currently has to be edited manually for this.

The instructions describe how to integrate a **Texas Instruments Inc. CC2531** Zigbee stick, but the same steps can be used analogously for other Zigbee sticks (ConBee, CC2652P etc.) or for other USB devices with the exception of USB network devices ( Bluetooth/Wlan) can be used.

* Proxmox version 7.1 was used for this part of the instructions.

### 1.) Gather information about the USB device
<details>

Establishing an SSH connection to Proxmox:

~~~ ssh root@ip address ~~~

<span style="color:red">**If the USB device is already connected to the Proxmox Host, unplug the device for now.**</span>

The following command lists all currently connected USB devices on the Proxmox host:

~~~ lsusb ~~~

![proxmoxlxc00](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc00.PNG)

Now the USB device to be integrated is plugged into the Proxmox host and the lsusb command is executed again

![proxmoxlxc01](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc01.PNG)

In the screenshot you can see that a new device with the USB bus number: **001** and the device number: **003** is listed.

This information is required to use the following command to e.g. output the **major device number** from the device:

~~~ ls -l /dev/bus/usb/001/003 ~~~

It is important to use the output of your USB bus number and device number with the command!

***ls -l /dev/bus/usb/usb-bus-number/device-number***

![proxmoxlxc02](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc02.PNG)

The USB device in this example has the major device number **189**, write down the value of your device in a text file with the comment: #1

![proxmoxlxc03](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc03.PNG)

Next we output the unique id of the USB device and note the output value in the text file with the note: #2

~~~ ls /dev/serial/by-id/ ~~~

![proxmoxlxc04](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc04.PNG)

![proxmoxlxc05](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc05.PNG)

As a last step, the major device number of the ttyACM is output and noted with the note: #3:

~~~ ls -l /dev/ttyACM* ~~~

![proxmoxlxc06](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc06.PNG)

>*If there is no output, check with "ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/" whether the USB device is integrated by the system as ttyUSB, if so replace all the following commands that refer to **ttyACM...* * obtain from **ttyUSB…** if there is no output it is not a USB CDC class device (serial communication) so all points to include from ttyACM can be ignored.*

So we wrote down **three** values from the USB device that are needed for the integration in the configuration file of the lxc.

</details>

### 2.) Edit LXC configuration file
<details>

Change to the LXC configuration directory on the Proxmox host with:

~~~ cd /etc/pve/lxc ~~~

The configuration file has the same ID number that was assigned when the lxc was created!

![proxmoxlxc08](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc08.PNG)

![proxmoxlxc09](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc09.PNG)

Before editing the configuration file, a backup copy should be created:

~~~ cp 201.conf 201.conf.backup ~~~

![proxmoxlxc10](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc10.PNG)

Now the configuration file is edited with vi or nano:

~~~ nano 201.conf ~~~

![proxmoxlxc11](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc11.PNG)

The following is added to the end of the configuration file:

~~~ lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 189:* rwm lxc.mount.entry: usb-Texas_Instruments_TI_CC2531_USB_CDC___0X00124B0012023529-if00 dev/serial/by-id/usb-Texas_Instruments_TI_CC2531_USB_CDC___0X00124B001202B001202B001202

lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 166:* rwm lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM0 dev/ttyACM0 none bind,optional,create=file ~~~

Replace the marked values with the noted entries from your note!

![12](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc12.PNG)

* The first line refers to the major device number **189** Note: #1
* In the second line, the unique id (usb-Texas_Instruments_TI_CC2531_USB_CDC___0X00124B0012023529-if00) from Note: #2 is given individually and with the absolute path, note that the complete text is written in one line without line breaks.
* In the third line, the major device number **166** from ttyACM from Note: #3 is given.

Save the configuration file (in the nano editor with the key combination: CTRL + o & CTRL + x to exit the editor)

</br>

<span style="color:orange">**DANGER! - If your container has active snapshots:**</span>

<details>

Then the lxc.cgroup code does not belong at the end of the config file but before the first entry of a snapshot.

![proxmoxlxc18](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc18.PNG)

</details>

<span style="color:orange">**DANGER! - Proxmox installation before version 7.0:**</span>

<details>

Replace the entries with

~~~ lxc.cgroup2 ~~~

through

~~~ lxc.cgroup ~~~

</details>

</br> Finally, issue the following command to set the required rights for ttyACM0:

~~~ chmod o+rw /dev/ttyACM* ~~~

To apply the adjustments to the lxc, perform a cold boot from the container with **pct stop id / pct start id**:

~~~ pct stop 201 ~~~

~~~ pct start 201 ~~~

</br>

<span style="color:green">**Tip it is best to store a copy of your working config file externally, since e.g. B. the integrated Proxmox backup service does not back up the content of your config!**</span>

</br>

</details>

### 3.) Check LXC USB passthrough & Zigbee instance configuration
<details>

Establishing an SSH connection to the LXC:

~~~ ssh user@ip address ~~~

With the commands:

~~~ lsusb ~~~

&

~~~ ls -l /dev ~~~

it is checked whether the adjustments to the configuration file were successful.

![proxmoxlxc13](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc13.PNG)

* As can be seen in the screenshot, the container now has access to the USB device.

* It is important that ttyACM0 has the same rights in the screenshot, i.e. **crw-rw-rw- 1 nobody nogroup**

>***If you don't check whether all values in the configuration file are set as described, the rights should still not match then jump to point 5.***

* The screenshot also shows that the device number of the cc2531 has changed from 3 to 4, this is because the stick has been unplugged and plugged in again in the meantime. However, since the unique ID and not the bus/device number is specified in the configuration file, the USB passthrough continues to work.

If, as described above, a Zigbee stick is passed through to the container, it must be entered in iobroker in the Zigbee adapter settings under COM port name

~~~ /dev/ttyACM0 ~~~

specified so that the correct device is addressed by the adapter.

![proxmoxlxc14](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc14.PNG)

</details>

### 4.) UDEV rule for permanent rights Adjustment of ttyACM0
<details>

At the end of step 3 was using the command

~~~ chmod o+rw /dev/ttyACM* ~~~

the appropriate rights are set for ttyACM0, but these rights changes are reset when the Proxmox host is restarted. A udev rule is required on the Proxmox host for permanent adjustment.

With lsusb we list the currently connected USB devices again:

~~~ lsusb ~~~

![proxmoxlxc15](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc15.PNG)

This time we write down the numerical values after ID in this case **0451:16a8**

* The first value: ***0451*** stands for the **idVendor** and the second value: ***16a8*** for **idProduct**.

Now the udev rule is created under /etc/udev/rules.d with vi or nano:

~~~ nano /etc/udev/rules.d/50-myusb.rules ~~~

and added the following content:

~~~ SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0451", ATTRS{idProduct}=="16a8", GROUP="users", MODE="0666" ~~~

![proxmoxlxc16](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc16.PNG)

Finally, run the following command to activate the udev rule:

~~~ udevadm control –reload ~~~

</details>

### 5.) Troubleshooting
<details>

**Error:** ttyACM0 rights in the lxc do not match or are lost after a short time (ConBee II).

~~~ ls -l /dev/ttyACM0 c--------- 0 nobody nogroup 166, 0 Feb 7 14:29 ttyACM0 ~~~

</br>

**Solution:** Use mknod to create a persistent binding to the container.

To do this, the **devices** folder is created in the path **"/var/lib/lxc/CONTAINERID"** and the binding is created in this folder with mknod:

~~~ mkdir /var/lib/lxc/201/devices ~~~

~~~ cd /var/lib/lxc/201/devices ~~~

~~~ mknod -m 666 ttyACM0 c 166 0 ~~~

+ *mknod creates a file named ttyACM0 in the path (as long as the file exists, the device is bound to the lxc)*

![proxmoxlxc17](../../de/install/media/proxmox/proxmoxlxc17.PNG)

***major device number and ttyACM.. adjust if necessary***

Then the entry in the lxc configuration file must be adjusted:

~~~ lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM0 dev/ttyACM0 none bind,optional,create=file ~~~

is replaced by:

~~~ lxc.mount.entry: /var/lib/lxc/CONTAINERID/devices/ttyACM0 dev/ttyACM0 none bind,optional,create=file ~~~
