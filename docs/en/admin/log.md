You get the following screen: ![complete log](../../de/admin/media/ADMIN_Log_download02.png)

Since lines are often cut off in the list in the log window, it is important to check here whether there is more information.

### 6 - host list
Only messages that come from the host set here are displayed in the log. In multihost environments you can set the host to be logged here.

Column headers 1 and 3 contain pull-down menus that serve as filter criteria, in column 4 a filter criterion can be freely entered

### 1 - source
With this pull-down menu, the messages can be filtered according to the logging instance. Only those instances for which there are entries on the page are displayed in the menu.

### 2 - time
The timestamp of the message is listed here. This column cannot be filtered.

### 3 - displayed log level
This menu can be used to set the severity of the message to be displayed. However, this is only a filter of the existing list.
In order to set the logging in a certain level for an instance, this must be set on the instance page.

Errors are shown in red font:
