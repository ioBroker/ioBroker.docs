# The admin interface
!> **Due to the scope of the documentation, this is only an overview; detailed information is provided on the pages that are linked to the tabs via the headings of the sections. Please click on the headings.**

The Adapter Admin is used to operate the entire ioBroker installation.
He provides a web interface. This is called up under ``<IP-Adresse des Servers>:8081``.

This adapter is created directly when ioBroker is installed - manual installation is not necessary

![The admin in the tile view](../../de/admin/media/ADMIN_Adapter_Kachel.png)

The following functions, among others, can be called up via the GUI provided by the adapter:

* Entry of system-wide settings
* Installation of further adapters and instances
* Access to the configuration of the instances
* Access to property overview
* Access to the status overview of the objects
* Access to the administration of users and groups
* Access to the log file
* Management of the hosts

The adapter view is divided into three areas:

1 - [Menu bar](#menüleiste)

2 - [Main window](#das-hauptfenster)

3 - [System settings](#systemeinstellungen)

## Menu bar
The menu bar contains several menu items. In the basic installation, these points are displayed as shown in the figure. After installing additional adapters, additional points can be activated or deactivated for a better overview using the triangle icon at the top left (1).

The menu bar with the tabs can be hidden via the **X** (2) in order to create more space on mobile devices.
