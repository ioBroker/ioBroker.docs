# ioBroker.tahoma

An ioBroker adapter for Somfy Tahoma. This project has no affiliation with Somfy. Initially based on the script taken from https://forum.iobroker.net/post/336001 and forked from https://github.com/StrathCole/ioBroker.tahoma.

The adapter connects to the Tahomalink end user API and controls the devices set up through Tahoma Box (and most likely Connexoon).  
The adapter is not feature-complete, yet, but it should support most actions for controlling blinds and shutters etc.

Please also read the [FAQ](https://github.com/Excodibur/ioBroker.tahoma/blob/master/FAQ.md) in case of issues first.

## Currently tested devices

Generally, this adapter should support all devices that can be accessed via __tahomalink.com__, but for the adapter developer it is difficult to guarantee this. Mainly, because the documention of the used Somfy-API is (at least publically) non-existant and the developer can only test Somfy-devices which he owns himself, or is able to test with support of willing participants.

The following Somfy devices were verified to work with this adapter:

- S&SO RS100 io 
- Oximo io
- Sun sensor Sunis io
- Temperature sensor io
- Smoke Sensor io
- Adapter Plug io

## Configuration

The following configuration parameters are supported by the adapter.
| Parameter                                               | (Default) value | Description |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Username                                                | _`<your Tahomalink user>`_ | Required to authenticate your Tahoma account. |
| Password                                                | _`<Your Tahomalink password>`_ | Required to authenticate your Tahoma account. |
| Polling interval                                        | `20000` | Time (in milliseconds) after which the adapter will try to get new data from Tahomalink. |
| Login Attempts <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>                | `3` | Amount of attempts to login again after login failure. |
| Delay between login attempts <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>  | `30` | Time (in seconds) to wait between login attempts. |
| Delay after failed login  <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>     | `120` | Time (in seconds) to wait, after all consecutive login attempts have failed. |
| Delay before applyqueue retry <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> | `1500` | Time (in milliseconds) to wait, before a second attempt is made to send changes from the internal apply queue to Tahoma, in case it got lost. |

 <sup>1</sup> These configuration values are only visible and configurable in Admin 5 (new GUI), or later.

 <sup>2</sup> All values are related to login to Tahomalink, which is mostly a blackbox from development point of view. If you configure the numbers too low here, experience has shown that there is a good chance Somfy will temporarily lock your account, so lower default values here with care!

## States

### tahoma.X.location

The state in this tree contain the personal information of the user like city, street address and longitude/latitude.

### tahoma.X.devices.*.deviceURL

This state contains the device URL that is used by Tahoma to identify the device.

### tahoma.X.devices.*.commands

These states contain button commands for controlling the devices. Most devices will support commands like `close` and `open` but also some more.  
Some of the commands have a `:slow` at the end if supported by the device. Using those enables low speed or so-called silent mode.

### tahoma.X.devices.*.states

These states contain current status of the devices as follows. Some of the states have a `:slow` at the end if supported by the device. Setting those enables low speed or so-called silent mode.


| Device state                                                | Editable | Purpose/Description |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:DeploymentState_            | &#10003; | Provides information about and controls the state of current deployment. 100 means fully deployed, 0 is undeployed. Not all devices have this value, some have `ClosureState` instead. |
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:TargetDeploymentState_      | &#10003; | See `tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:DeploymentState`. Use this to e.g. change blind position directly. |
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.coreClosureState_                | &#10003; | Provides information about and controls the state of current closure. 100 means fully closed, 0 is open. Not all devices have this value, some have `DeploymentState` instead. |
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:TargetClosureState_         | &#10003; | See `tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:ClosureState` |
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:OrientationState_           | &#10003; | Provides information about and ocntrols the orientation (e. g. for shutters) of slats. Not all devices offer this value | 
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:TargetOrientationState_     | &#10003; | See `tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:OrientationState` |  
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:NameState_                  |          | Contains the current name of the device. |
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:OpenClosedState_            |          | Contains `closed` if the device is 100% closed or 0% deployed and `open` otherwise. |
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:PriorityLockTimerState_     |          | If a sensor has locked the device this is stated here, e. g. a wind sensor blocking an awning. |
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:RSSILevelState_             |          | The current signal quality of the device. |
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:StatusState_                |          | `available` if the device is currently available. |
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.io:PriorityLockLevelState_       |          | See `tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:PriorityLockTimerState` |
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.io:PriorityLockOriginatorState_  |          | See `tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:PriorityLockTimerState` |
| _tahoma.X.devices.*.states.moving_                          |          | States if the device is currently moving. `0 = stopped`, `1 = up/undeploy`, `2 = down/deploy`, `3 = unknown direction` |
