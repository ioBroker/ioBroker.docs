# ioBroker.tahoma

An ioBroker adapter for Somfy Tahoma. This project has no affiliation with Somfy. Initially based on the script taken from https://forum.iobroker.net/post/336001.

The adapter connects to the Tahomalink end user API and controls the devices set up through Tahoma Box (and most likely Connexoon).  
The adapter is not feature-complete, yet, but it should support most actions for controlling blinds and shutters etc.

Follwing some of the states created by the adapter.

## tahoma.X.location

The state in this tree contain the personal information of the user like city, street address and longitude/latitude.

## tahoma.X.devices.*.deviceURL

This state contains the device URL that is used by Tahoma to identify the device.

## tahoma.X.devices.*.commands

These states contain button commands for controlling the devices. Most devices will support commands like `close` and `open` but also some more.  
Some of the commands have a `:slow` at the end if supported by the device. Using those enables low speed or so-called silent mode.

## tahoma.X.devices.*.states

These states contain current status of the devices as follows. All settings marked with `[**]` are editable to controll device's behaviour / send commands.  
Some of the states have a `:slow` at the end if supported by the device. Setting those enables low speed or so-called silent mode.

`[**] tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:DeploymentState` - Provides information about and controls the state of current deployment. 100 means fully deployed, 0 is undeployed. Not all devices have this value, some have `ClosureState` instead.  
`[**] tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:TargetDeploymentState` - See `tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:DeploymentState`  
`[**] tahoma.X.devices.*.states.coreClosureState` - Provides information about and controls the state of current closure. 100 means fully closed, 0 is open. Not all devices have this value, some have `DeploymentState` instead.  
`[**] tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:TargetClosureState` - See `tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:ClosureState`  
`[**] tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:OrientationState` - Provides information about and ocntrols the orientation (e. g. for shutters) of slats. Not all devices offer this value.  
`[**] tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:TargetOrientationState` - See `tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:OrientationState`  
`tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:NameState` - Contains the current name of the device.  
`tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:OpenClosedState` - Contains `closed` if the device is 100% closed or 0% deployed and `open` otherwise.  
`tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:PriorityLockTimerState` - If a sensor has locked the device this is stated here, e. g. a wind sensor blocking an awning.  
`tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:RSSILevelState` - The current signal quality of the device.  
`tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:StatusState` - `available` if the device is currently available.  
`tahoma.X.devices.*.states.io:PriorityLockLevelState` - See `tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:PriorityLockTimerState`  
`tahoma.X.devices.*.states.io:PriorityLockOriginatorState` - See `tahoma.X.devices.*.states.core:PriorityLockTimerState`  
`tahoma.X.devices.*.states.moving` - States if the device is currently moving. `0 = stopped`, `1 = up/undeploy`, `2 = down/deploy`, `3 = unknown direction`
