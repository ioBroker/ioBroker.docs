_scenes Adapter_ can create scenes and execute them in ioBroker environment.

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

This adapter can create three types of scenes: 
- **scenes**
- **groups**
- **virtual groups**

## Scenes
**Scenes** will be created if setting "set on false" are not used. 
Every scene can be configured individually, so you can have **scenes** and **groups** in one instance of adapter.
The **scene** is just list of states id and values, that these states must have by activation of the scene. E.g. we have created on the scene "_scene.allLightInBath_":

```
  scene.allLightInBath
  |- hm-rpc.0.BOTTOM_LIGHT.STATE  - true
  +- hm-rpc.0.TOP_LIGHT.STATE     - true
```

To activate the scene we must set "_scene.allLightInBath_" to true (e.g. over script or vis). Then both states will be set to desired values, to **true**. 
The value of _scene.allLightInBath_ will be **true** too. If we manually switch of the top light the value of the _scene.allLightInBath_ will go to **false**.
And again to **true** if we will switch manually the light on.

Let's add to the **scene** the fan:

```
  scene.allLightInBath
  |- hm-rpc.0.BOTTOM_LIGHT.STATE  - true
  |- hm-rpc.0.TOP_LIGHT.STATE     - true
  |- hm-rpc.0.FAN.STATE          - true
  |- hm-rpc.0.FAN.STATE          - false (delay 60000ms)
```

In this case the fan will be switched on ba activation of the **scene** and will be switched off in one minute. 
After the fan will be switched off the value of _scene.allLightInBath_ will go to **false**, because not all states are equal to desired values. 
States with delay are not participate in calculations.

You can test the scene with a "play" button.
Additionally, you can link this **scene** direct with other scene ID. E.g. if you have a sensor on the door you can select it as a trigger:

```
  trigger
    id:        hm-rpc.0.DOOR_SENSOR.STATE
    condition: ==
    value:     true
```

And every time you will open the door in the bath all lights with fan will be switched on.

## Groups
**Groups** are like virtual channels. You can create with the help of **groups** virtual device from several actuators and control them together, like one device.
Let's modify our sample with the bath's lights.  

```
  scene.allLightInBath             "set on true"    "set on false" 
  |- hm-rpc.0.BOTTOM_LIGHT.STATE  - true             false
  +- hm-rpc.0.TOP_LIGHT.STATE     - true             false
```

If you link this **group** with the door sensor like:

```
  trigger on true
    id:        hm-rpc.0.DOOR_SENSOR.STATE
    condition: ==
    value:     true

  trigger on false
    id:        hm-rpc.0.DOOR_SENSOR.STATE
    condition: ==
    value:     false
```

Every time you will open the door all lights in a bath will be switched on. The value of the _scene.allLightInBath_ will go to **true**.
If you close the door the lights will be switched off, and the value of _scene.allLightInBath_ will go to **false**. 

It is useless, but it is good as an example.

If you will manually switch on one light, the value of the _scene.allLightInBath_ will go to **uncertain**.

Delays can be used in the **group** too, but the states with delay are not participate in calculations of the current value of **group**.

## Virtual groups
**Virtual groups** are like virtual channels and like groups, but can have any kind of values: numbers, strings and so on. 
You can create virtual group to control all shutters in living room. By writing 40% into virtual group all shutters will be set to 40%. 

## Save actual states as scene
To save actual states in some scene you can send a message to the adapter:
```
sendTo(
    'scenes.0', 
    'save', 
    {sceneId: 
        'scene.0.SCENE_ID', // scene ID 
        isForTrue: true     // true if actual values must be saved for `true` state and `false` if for false 
    }, 
    result => result.err && console.error(result.error) // optional
);
```
The adapter will read all actual values for IDs defined in this scene and save it as configured ones.
