## A Google Home adapter for ioBroker

This plugin allows to detect video and/or audio Google Home devices. For each detected Home device an ioBroker device is created. This device displays the status of the device and allows to send it a new URL to cast.

Build on top of the following projects:
  * [ioBroker](http://www.iobroker.net)
  * [node-castv2-client](https://github.com/thibauts/node-castv2-client) as Home client library.

## Instructions

1. Install into ioBroker
   1. Go to your ioBroker Adapters tab
   2. Select and install Google Home adapter
2. Add an instance of the Google Home adapter
   * it should automatically run after it is installed
3. (optional) If you plan to stream local files you need to configure the adapter
   * you need to have an ioBroker web server instance
4. Check your log: you should see logs about the detected devices
5. Write an URL such as [http://edge.live.mp3.mdn.newmedia.nacamar.net/ps-dieneue_rock/livestream_hi.mp3](http://edge.live.mp3.mdn.newmedia.nacamar.net/ps-dieneue_rock/livestream_hi.mp3) to the chromecast.0.`<your chromecast name>`.player.url2play
6. The URL should start playing on your device

## Features

* detect devices with multicast-dns
  * optionally add additional manually configured devices in admin pannel
* create ioBroker objects for each found device
* status, player, media and metadata channels
* control Google Home device from adapter
  * set volume
  * mute/unmute
  * stop broadcasting
  * pause
  * play url (chromecast.0.`<your Google Home name>`.player.url2play)
    * tested with MP3
      * Full list of formats [here](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media).
    * when the url does not start with http then assume that this is a local file
      * export file via ioBroker web server
    * it only plays fist file from playlist files such as .m3u
* Vis widget
  * NOTE: requires [patched vis adapter](https://github.com/angelnu/ioBroker.vis).
* Initial support for Chromecast audio groups
  * Note: this does not work with SSDP -> disable by default in adapter settings
* Play again last played stream: just set _chromecast.0.`<your device>`.status.playing_ to _true_

## What is missing?

* add state machine to track states: detected ->connected -> player loader -> playing
* add retries: sometimes the Google Home fails to respond to a request
* more testing
