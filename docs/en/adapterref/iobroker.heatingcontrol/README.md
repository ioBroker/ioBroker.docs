## Adapter for controlling your heating system.

Features:
* Control the setpoint temperature levels of all thermostats per schedules
* Configure multiple heating periods for each day and night 
* Supports all kind of thermostats (precondition: it must be available in ioBroker)
* Homematic device autodetection 
* supports multiple profiles
* If there is no direct connection between the thermostat and the actuator, the actuator can be switched directly out of the adapter
* Currently, the actuator is switched off directly when the setpoint temperature is reached. As soon as the setpoint temperature is below the actual temperature, the actuator will be switched on. (To do: implement improved control)
* unlimited number of thermostats, actuators and sonsors per room are supported
* Thermostat, actuator and sensor are automatically detected per room. The function (eg "heating") is used for this.
* Rooms can be excluded within the admin interface, if a room contains a thermostat but should not be controlled
* sensor is used to reduce target temperature (e.g. if a window is open); optionally with SensorDelay
* interface to Feiertag-Adapter or any others to detect public holiday. Public holiday can be a normal day or like sundays. (admin setting)
* manual temperature override for a certain time
* predefined heating period
* take over changes from thermostat (optional)
* visualization from [Pittini](https://github.com/Pittini/iobroker-heatingcontrol-vis) is supported. Thank you!

[FAQ](doc/FAQ.md)


## Installation

## Settings
### main
* Function = Function to be used to detect thermostats, actuators and sensors per room. It's one of the sytem enums
* timezone = to be used for cron to adjust cron jobs
* Path to Feiertag - Adapter = if you wnat to use Feiertag-Adapter to dectect automatically public holiday for today then set the path here (e.g. feiertage.0)
* delete all devices when admin opens = should be disabled. Enable it only when you need to delete all room, actuator and sensor settings. A device search will be executed when adapter admin opens
* sensor used = if you have window sensors and you want to decrease target temperature when window is open then enable that option
* actuators used = if you want to control actuators directly from adapter. Just in case there is no direct connection between thermostat and actuator.
* use actuators if no heating period = only valid with actuators. Defines how actuators are set when no heating period is active
* use actuators if no thermostat available = only valid with actuators. If you have rooms without thermostat but with heating actuator you can switche them on or off permanantly


### profile
* Profile Type = three different profile types (Monday - Sunday, or Monday - Friday and Suturday/Sunday or every day) are supported
* number of profiles = if you need more then on profile increase that value. You can then select which profile will be used.
* number of periods = define how many daily sections with different temperature you need. As more you set as more datapoints will be created. Better to use a low value (e.g. 5)
* "public holiday like sunday = if you want to set target temperatures on public holiday like sunday enable that option. Otherwise public holiday settings are the same as on normal days
* HeatingPeriod = start and end date of heating period. Used to set "HeatingPeriodActive" 



### devices
* a list of all rooms. You can disable a room here. 
* press edit button on right hand side to open settings window for thermostats, actuators and sensors for that room

### Edit Room
* here you can verifay and set object ID's for thermostats, actuators and sensors
* you can add manually new thermostats, actuators or sensors. Just press + button. Then you get an empty line which needs to filled up. The Edit-Button opens a list of available devices on the system
* thermostats:
** name, temperature target OID and current temperature OID should be set. 
* actuators
** name and OID for state should be set
* sensors
** name and OID for current state should be set

## datapoints

| DP name             | description                                                                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HeatingPeriodActive | if off, the profiles will not be used                                                               | 
| CurrentProfile      | select current profile (1 based, means profile 1 use datapoints under heatingcontrol.0.Profiles.0 ) | 
| LastProgramRun      | shows last time when adapter run                                                                    | 

### temperature decrease / increase

| DP name           | description                                                | target temperature for relative decrease                                       | target temperature for absolute decrease                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| GuestsPresent     | increase temperature because guests wants it warmer        | increase current profile temperature by Profiles.0.room.GuestIncrease          | set target to Profiles.0.room.absolute.GuestIncrease          | 
| PartyNow          | decrease temperature because it's becoming hot'            | decrease current profile temperature by Profiles.0.room.PartyDecrease          | set target to Profiles.0.room.absolute.PartyDecrease          | 
| Present           | we are present, if we are not present decrease temperature | decrease current profile temperature by Profiles.0.room.AbsentDecrease         | set target to Profiles.0.room.absolute.AbsentDecrease         | 
| VacationAbsent    | we are absent, so decrease also on weekend                 | decrease current profile temperature by Profiles.0.room.VacationAbsentDecrease | set target to Profiles.0.room.absolute.VacationAbsentDecrease | 


* in both szenarious only one lowering is used (in previous version of adapter more then one degreases could be used)
* in absolute degrease szenario only target values not equal 0°C are used. If you do not need any lowering for a certain room then keep decrease-values at 0°C

### no heating period
there are three options

* fix Temperature per room
if this option is selected, a new datapoint in object tree appears for every room. Here you can set a fix target temperature which is set when heating period is not active.
* fix Temperature for all rooms
with this option you can use one target temperature for every room when heating period is not active
* nothing
with this option nothing will be sent to thermostat if no heating period is active. Target temperature remain from last taget when heating period still was active.
In that case and if you use actuators from the adapter then you have the possibilty to define how actuators should be set (off, on, or leave it as it is) 


## others

* HolidayPresent / PublicHolidyToday
If you enable "Holiday present like sunday" or "public holiday like sunday" in admin, the profile for sunday is used
when adapter is informed that today is a public holiday or you are at home in holiday.

### window open
if "use sensors" is active and sensor(s) for a room is / are configured then

* decrease current profile temperature when window is open (true) by Profiles.0.room.WindowOpenDecrease if relative decrease is configured
* set target to Profiles.0.room.absolute.WindowOpenDecrease when window is open (true) if  absolute decrease is configured

optionally a delay can be used. If window is opened only for a short time sensor delay can avoid from reduce and back to normal in very short times.

## ical support
you can use your calendar or any other datapoint to change datapoints in adapter.
Just configure events from ical or other datapoints in admin. Supported are

| datapoint                           | description
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|heatingcontrol.0.Present             | set it to true (in case of boolean) or to a number higher then limit (in case of number)
|heatingcontrol.0.HolidayPresent      | set it to true when you at home in your holiday
|heatingcontrol.0.VacationAbsent      | set it to true when you not at home in your holiday
|heatingcontrol.0.GuestsPresent       | set it to true (in case of boolean) or to a number higher then limit (in case of number)
|heatingcontrol.0.PartyNow            | set it to true (in case of boolean) or to a number higher then limit (in case of number)

hint: with number datapoints you could count how many people are in the house and then decide, e.g. we have enough for a party...

## use changes from thermostat

Many user asked for an option to take over changes from thermostat into adapter. Now a four options are implemented:

| option                   | description                                                
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| no                       | changes from thermostat are ignored
| as override              | changes from thermostat are taken as override; override time must be set in advance in heatingcontrol.0.Rooms.RoomName.TemperaturOverrideTime
|                          | if override time is not set, than override is not executed
| as new profile setting   | changes from thermostat are taken as target temperature for current profile period
| until next profile point | changes from thermostat are taken as target temperature until next profile point. This is a manual mode, so only Window sensors are used. All other 
|                          | increases / decreases are ignored. There is a datapoint in every room to disable manual mode before reaching next profile point.

## extend override when temperature is changed
The standard behavior for override is, when you change temperature the override time is not changed. E.g if you start override for 20 minutes with 25°C
and you change to 28°C after 15 minutes then 28°C is only used for the last 5 minutes. With that option you restart override whenever you change override temperature.
In example above 28°C would then be used for 20 minutes which leads to 15 minutes 25°C and 20 minutes 28°C 

## override mode
There are two mode adjustable in admin for all rooms.
* timer controlled
this is the wellknown function, which uses a temperature and a duration. The given temperature is used for the duration and then temperature target will set back to value in auto mode
* until next profile point
this is a new function. Here we can use a temperature override until next profile point. The duration will be ignored but must be non-zero!


## Thermostat handles "window is open"
Some thermostats can handle "window is open" by itself. In those cases a direct connection between window sensor and thermostat is configured and thermostat reduces
target temperature by itslef when a window is opened.
In combination with option "use of changes from thermostat"  / "until next profil point" will lead this to an unexpected manual state. In this situation the reduced 
temperature  would be used until next profil point.
But the adpater can handle this behavior. You must enable option "Thermostat handles 'Window is Open'" and you can configure window sensors also in adapter.
When window is opened the adapter waits for max. 3 seconds for new target temperature from thermostat. If it receives a new target temperature in that time it will be used
as a reduced absolut temperature. Status will then be "auto window open". As soon as the window is closed the status goes back to auto and thermostat sets back the
original target temperature
**Attention** do not use Sensor Open Delay in that case. If you use it, the Window open event appears after target temperature received from thermostat. This ends up in 
manual state. 


## Copy period and copy profile
``
heatingcontrol.0.Profiles.1.CopyProfile
heatingcontrol.0.Profiles.1.Room.CopyProfile
``

and

``
heatingcontrol.0.Profiles.1.Küche.Fri.CopyPeriods
``

CopyProfile copies the entire content of the profile where the button is pressed to the next profile. In the above example, the button is in profile 1. The button copies everything from profile 1 to profile 2.
If you want to copy only one room, use the button in a certain room.

The CopyPeriods are available per day or Mon-Fri per room. This copies the periods to the next section. In the above example, the CopyPeriods copies all periods from Friday in the kitchen room to the periods on Saturday in the kitchen room.
So you can e.g. in the profile "every day separately", copy the periods from Monday to Sunday ...

## Issues and Feature Requests
* If you are faced with any bugs or have feature requests for this adapter, please create an issue within the GitHub issue section of the adapter at [github](https://github.com/rg-engineering/ioBroker.heatingcontrol/issues). Any feedback is appreciated and will help to improve this adapter.

## known issues

### Adapter with Homematic IP Fußbodenheizungsaktor HmIP-FAL230-C10 – 10fach, 230 V 
It seems that HmIP-FAL230-C10 can not be used directly as an actuator in combination with that adapter. If you use HmIP-FAL230-C10 together with Homematic thermostats it should work.
see also [Forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/22579/test-adapter-heatingcontrol-v1-0-x/1553)

### Window-open function of HM thermostats
HM thermostats have an open window function in two variants. On the one hand as temperature drop detection and on the other hand in connection with a window contact.
This function causes the adapter to switch to manual mode when the window is opened. Ideally, this function should be deactivated so as not to interfere with the functionality of the adapter.
If thermostat use information from window sensor then "thermostat handles window open" option should be enabled.

When the adapter crashes or an other Code error happens, this error message that also appears in the ioBroker log is submitted to Sentry.  All of this helps me to provide error free adapters that basically never crashs.
