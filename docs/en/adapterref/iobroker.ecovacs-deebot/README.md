[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/iobroker.ecovacs-deebot.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.ecovacs-deebot)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/iobroker.ecovacs-deebot.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.ecovacs-deebot)
[![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/mrbungle64/ioBroker.ecovacs-deebot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrbungle64/ioBroker.ecovacs-deebot)

This adapter uses the [ecovacs-deebot.js](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ecovacs-deebot.js) library.

## Models

So far, only devices that communicate with the **XMPP** protocol work properly. 
Devices that communicate with the **MQTT** protocol are experimental.

You can check this with the state value `info.communicationProtocol` after successful connection establishment (values: `XMPP`, `MQTT`).

### These models work to full extent
* Deebot Slim 2
* Deebot Ozmo 930

### These models work to almost full extent
* Deebot 601
* Deebot 710/711
* Deebot 900/901
* Deebot Ozmo 610
* Deebot Ozmo 950

### These models should work to (almost) full extent
* Deebot N79T
* Deebot 600/605
* Deebot Ozmo 960 (not tested)

### These models should work partially
* Deebot Ozmo 900

## Control

### Buttons

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| charge | return to charging station |
| clean | start auto cleaning |
| edge | start edge cleaning |
| playSound | play a sound for locating the bot |
| spot | start spot cleaning |
| stop | stop the cleaning process |
| pause | pause the cleaning process |
| spotArea `0`-`9` | up to 9 buttons for the areas defined in the Ecovacs app |

### Area/zone cleaning

#### SpotArea

* spot areas are named with letters in the mobile app
    * in the adapter they are mapped to a number:
        * `A` = `0`
        * `B` = `1`
        * etc.
* `spotArea`: comma-separated list of numbers
    * starting by `0` (e.g. `1,3` = areas `B` and `D`) for areas to be cleaned
* the number of buttons (`spotArea_0-9`) can be configured in the Adapter Configuration

#### CustomArea

* comma-separated list of exactly 4 position values for `x1,y1,x2,y2` (e.g. `-3975,2280,-1930,4575`)
    * position `0,0,0,0` seems to be the position of the charging station
    * a value of `1000` seems to be the distance of approximately 1 meter

#### WaterLevel

* Control and display water level (`low`, `medium`, `high` and `max`)
