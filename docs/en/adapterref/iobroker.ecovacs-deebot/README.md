This adapter uses the [ecovacs-deebot.js](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ecovacs-deebot.js) library.

## Features

Some noteworthy features are:

* Retrieve information (e.g. battery, cleaning log, consumable, cleaning and charging status)
* Send clean commands (e.g. auto, spot area, custom area) and various other commands (e.g. play sound, reset consumables)
* Save the last run custom area and rerun the saved areas
* Adjustment of vacuum power (clean speed) and water level
* Retrieve information during the cleaning process (e.g. current position and area)
* Retrieve information of the maps incl. spot areas and virtual boundaries
* Delete, save and recreate single virtual boundaries as well as a full set of virtual boundaries *)
* Function for loading the current map image *)

*) Experimental

Please note: Some features are only available for some models

## Models

### Supported models

* Deebot 900/901
* Deebot OZMO 930
* Deebot OZMO 920/950

The models listed are those that I have in use myself or which are technically identical to these.

### These models should work properly or at least partially

* Deebot Slim 2
* Deebot N79 series
* Deebot M88
* Deebot 500
* Deebot 600/601/605
* Deebot 710/711/711s
* Deebot OZMO 610
* Deebot OZMO 900/905
* Deebot OZMO Slim 10/11
* Deebot OZMO T5
* Deebot U2 series
* Deebot N3 MAX
* Deebot N7
* Deebot N8 series
* Deebot T8 series
* Deebot T9 series

The models listed are either already known to work or are technically similar to these models.
Nevertheless, the functionality may be partially limited.

I try to achieve a wide range of functionality, but decide this case by case depending on complexity and various other criteria.
There is of course no claim to full functionality.

## Installation

It is recommended to use version 12.x or 14.x of Node.js.

The minimum required version is still 10.x, **but that will change soon**.

This adapter uses the [node-canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) library for some map-related functionality
which may require the installation of some additional packages.

The installation of canvas is optional and not necessary for models without map functionality, but for full functional
range please install the following packages.

For Debian-based Linux systems the following commands should be executed:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev
```

A reboot might be necessary before executing the next command
```bash
sudo npm install canvas --unsafe-perm=true
```

For instructions for other systems visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas#compiling

## Usage

### States

* Information about the states can be found [here](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ioBroker.ecovacs-deebot/wiki/States-%28EN%29) (English) and [here](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ioBroker.ecovacs-deebot/wiki/Datenpunkte-%28DE%29) (German)

## FAQ

* Frequently asked questions can be found [here](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ioBroker.ecovacs-deebot/wiki/FAQ)

## Known issues

* For some models (e.g. Deebot OZMO 930) it is recommended
  to [schedule a restart](https://www.iobroker.net/#en/documentation/admin/instances.md#The%20page%20content) once a day
  because there are some reports that the connection is lost after approx. 24 hours
* Some cleaning functions may not work with Deebot 710/711/711s. Please use version 0.5.8 for now.
* The "edge" function does not work with Deebot U2 (starts auto clean instead)
* Some "cleaninglog" states are empty on T9 series ("last20Logs", "lastCleaningDate" and "lastCleaningMapImageURL")
