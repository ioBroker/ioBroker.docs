**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

ioBroker Adapter to load 24h weather forecast for your location from [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/).
The adapter loads all 15min (default) daily and hourly forecast data.

## Notes
You can use this adapter with providing an official "PWS owner" API-key or leave API key empty to use keys extracted out of the WU webpage.

## Icon Sets

There are some different Icon Sets available when using "Legacy API", see below. For the usabe with the new API the image names have changed (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dNCf6nF6cjm4oOxQxjtqNuAvG_iEe5f9MQH1xlCeV4s/edit) and are now number based ... they can be downloaded from e.g. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6fWQWXuE09OOWtBOXJNX190TDQ and could be used as custom set (see below). 

In Adapter settings change "Custom Icon-Base-URL" to one of the available Icon Set on Weatherunderground:
