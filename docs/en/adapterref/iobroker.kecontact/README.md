# ioBroker adapter for KEBA KeContact P20 or P30 and BMW i wallbox

Control your charging station and use automatic regulation e.g. to charge your vehicle by photovoltaic surplus using its UDP protocol.

## Install

Install this adapter via ioBroker Admin:
1. Open instance config dialog
2. Enter the IP address of your KEBA KeContact wallbox
3. Adjust the refresh interval if needed
4. Save the configuration
5. Start the adapter

## Configuration

### KeContact IP Address

This is the IP address of your KEBA KeContact or BMW i wallbox.

### Firmware check

Once a day adapter will check if a newer firmware is available at KEBA website. This information will be printed to log as warning.

### Passive Mode

Activate this option if you wnat to control your wallbox by your own and yu do not wish this adapter to do some automatics. In this case all subsequent options regarding PV automatics and power limitation will be ignored.

### Subsequent wallbox

Activate this option if this a subsequent wallbox in your environment. Currently, only one wallbox can be managed actively. All others (seperate instances) must check this option because of only one instance can receive broadcast messages. This wallbox/instance will be running in passive mode.

### Load charging sessions

You can check this option to periodically download the latest charging sessions (30) from your wall box.
ATTENTION for users from version v1.1.1 and below: you have to check this option to still receive for charging sessions!

### Refresh Interval

This is the interval in seconds how often the wallbox should be queried for new charging values.

The default value is 10 minutes which is a good balance between the load for the KeConnect and having up-to-date information in ioBroker.

### PV automatics

To charge your vehicle accordingly to a surplus (e.g. by photovoltaics) you can also define states which represent surplus and regard of main power. These value are used to calculate amperage which can be used for charging. By additional values you can define
* toggle X1 option if you want to use X1 input from charging station to control whether to charge with full power or by photovoltaic automatic
* a different mimimum amperage than the default 6 A (only needed for e.g. Renault Zoe)
* a value of regard power that may be used to start charging (that means charging will start even if not enough surplus is available - suggested 0 W for 1 phases charging, 500 W to 2000 W for 3 phases charging)
* an increment for amperage (suggested 500 mA)
* a value of regard that may be temporarily used to uphold charging session (that means charging will stop later even if enough surplus is no longer available - starting regard will be added - suggested 500 W)
* minimum duration of charging session (even if surplus is no longer sufficient, a charging session will last at least this time - suggested 300 sec)
* time to continue charging session each time surplus is no longer sufficient (to bridge the time on cloudy days)

### power limitation

You can also limit max. power of your wallbox to limit main power. E.g. when running night-storage heaters you might have to respect a maximum power limitation.
If you enter a value, your wallbox will be limited continously to not pass your power limit.
Up to three states of energy meters can be specified for limitation. All values will be added to calculate current consumption.
An extra checkbox is used to specified whether wallbox power is included (in this case wallbox power will be subtracted from the state values).

### dynamic options

Additionally there are some states to influence behaviour of photovoltaics automatic on the fly, e.g. by a script of your own updating these values according to your needs)
* kecontact.0.automatic.photovoltaics - actives photovoltaics automatic (true) or will charge vehicle with maximum power when set to false
* kecontact.0.automatic.calcPhases - defines the current number of phases to be used for charging calculation. This is needed for Keba Deutschland edition and can be used for initial charging session for all charging stations
* kecontact.0.automatic.addPower - defines an amount of watts of regard allowed to charge your vehicle (same as in options)
* kecontact.0.automatic.pauseWallbox - stops every charging session immediately as long a set to true
* kecontact.0.automatic.limitCurrent - limits your charging to specified amperage in mA (0 = no limitation)

Sample:
To charge your vehicle with a constant amperage of 6A regardless of surplus, set photovoltaics to false and limitCurrent to 6000.
