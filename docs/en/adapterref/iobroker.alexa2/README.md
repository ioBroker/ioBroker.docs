**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

This adapter allows you to remotely control your Alexa (Amazon Echo) devices.

Big thanks go to soef for version 1 of the adapter and to Hauke and ruhr70 for ideas in their scripts from ioBroker-Forum (especially the media progress updates)!
Also, big thanks to meicker for support in documenting all of this and numerous users from ioBroker Forum for their testing support!

Detailed information Speak and Announcement: Type in here what you want Alexa to say. You can also adjust the volume of Alexa by giving a percentage before your text.
Example: 10;Alexa is saying Alexa with 10% volume, while 100;Alexa is 100% volume.
Normally, you only can send 250 characters per speak command. By using the semicolon, it is possible to write as much as you want, as long as you separate 250 characters with a semicolon.
Alexa will then speak the text after each other with a small break. You also can use the volume together with more 255 blocks by writing #Volume;#Block1;#Block2, a.s.o A volume set here will be used over a defined speak-volume.

Partially also sounds from https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/ask-soundlibrary.html work. Specify in speak or ssml as `<audio src="soundbank://soundlibrary/animals/amzn_sfx_bear_groan_roar_01"/>`. Details and discussion please at https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/27509/ssml-audio

## Installation
As usual using stable repository, the latest repository or uses the ioBroker "Install" options from GitHub

## Send Alexa Device Command sequences via messages
All commands to the alexa devices can be sent via the adapter to single devices or to groups. The adapter supports sending of these commands and - if needed - also combines them to set a specific volume before a voice output and restore the original volume afterward.

When you want to send custom sequences to alexa devices, you can create a Routine and trigger the routine also via the states.

If this is not flexible enough, the adapter offers since version 3.14.0 a way to send commands via messages.

You provide an array structure which will be converted to commands. There are two types of options for one array element:

**A command**
```json
{
    "command": "speak", // command like the state name in Commands states
    "value": "This is a test speak.", // value like value you set on state
    "device": "..." // optional: serialNumber of the device to send this command to
}
```

**A sequence definition**

```json
{
    "sequenceType": "...", // "SerialNode" or "ParallelNode"
    "nodes": [...] // array of commands or sequences
}
```

Sending the message e.g. using JavaScript adapter looks like this:

```javascript
adapter.sendTo(
    "alexa.0", // target
    "sendSequenceCommand", // command
    { // value
        "deviceSerialNumber": "...", // Serial number of one device to get Meta data which will be used if no device is pecified on the commands
        "sequenceNodes": [...], // list of sequences or commands
        "sequenceType": "SerialNode" // "SerialNode" or "ParallelNode" for the provided sequenceNodes on main level. Default is "SerialNode"
    }, (err, res) => {
        console.log(err);
        console.log(JSON.stringify(res));
    }
);
```

When commands are executed as "ParallelNode" in parallel, which mainly makes sense to send commands to different devices. Commands as "SerialNode" are executed one after the other - **Amazon takes care about this and handles this, not the adapter!** 

A structure like the following is possible:

```json
... // use ParallelNode on main level
"sequenceNodes": [
    {
        "sequenceType": "SerialNode",
        "nodes": [
            {
                "command": "speak",
                "value": "This is a test speak.",
                "device": "DeviceA"
            },
            {
                "command": "speak",
                "value": "This is a second test speak.",
                "device": "DeviceA"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "sequenceType": "SerialNode",
        "nodes": [
            {
                "command": "speak",
                "value": "This is a test speak.",
                "device": "DeviceB"
            },
            {
                "command": "speak",
                "value": "This is a second test speak.",
                "device": "DeviceB"
            },
            {
                "sequenceType": "ParallelNode",
                "nodes": [
                    {
                        "command": "flashbriefing",
                        "device": "DeviceC"
                    },
                    {
                        "command": "flashbriefing",
                        "device": "Device B"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]

```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem with Cookie determination with SMS based 2FA flow
If you still use the SMS/E-Mail based 2FA flow, then this might not work. Please update the 2FA/OTP method in the amazon settings to the current process! Not working could also mean that a Error 404/Page not found is shown. ALso then check and upgrade OTP settings!

### The Alexa App opens when I try to log in
If you open the Proxy URL from a mobile device where also the Alexa App is installed on, it might be that it does not work because Amazon might open the Alexa App. So please use a device or PC where the Alexa App is not installed!

### I get a page shown with a QR code telling me to scan it
If you see a page that tells you that "alexa.amazon.xx is deprecated" and you should use the alexa app and with a QR code on it when you enter the Proxy URL" then this means that you call the proxy URL ith a different IP/Domainname then you entered in the "proxy own IP" settings, or you adjusted the IP shown in the Adapter configuration.

The "own IP" setting **needs to** match the IP/Domainname you use to call the proxy URL!

### Problems with Cookie determination via E-Mail/Password
Sometimes Amazon has weired checks in place when they detect unexpected traffic on Login.
This can result in the problem that a captcha needs to be answered in order to log in.
Mostly, this captcha needs to be answered once and after this, the login works without Captcha.

When you need to answer such a captcha, then try to do the following:
* Use a common Browser (e.g., Chrome)
* disable Javascript!
* clear all cookies that may exist for Amazon or use Private/Incognito mode of the browser
* call https://alexa.amazon.de
* you should get a login form (normally displayed for older mobile browsers)
* login there with your Amazon credentials where the Echo/Alexa is registered in
* you may need to log in twice or solve a Captcha
* In the end, you should see "https://alexa.amazon.de/spa/index.html" as URL but without any real content (because JS is still disabled), BUT THIS IS COMPLETELY OK!!!!
* now try to get cookie again
* if it still not works, do it again and check the User-Agent and accept-Language from your browser and use those in adapter on next try

Additionally, the Accept-Language-Header (default to "de-DE") needs to match with your language/the browser language/the language of the amazon page you log in.

You can also try to play around with the User-Agent and use one which more matches to the system type you use.
As example using "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36" as User-Agent was reported as working better when ioBroker runs on a linux system.

You can override all those parameters in the adapter configuration.

### Push Connections do not connect
Sometimes it could happen that because of too many connection tries aAmazon blocks the push connection endpoint for a specific IP and "device".

If the Push connection is never established, then you can try to use the following:
* delete the instance of the adapter
* check if there are files like /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.alexa2/formerDataStore*.json - if existing please delete them
* add new instance and get new cookie

Then it should work again

### I have too many App/"This device" devices in my list of Echo-Devices
The adapter reads whatever Amazon reports. Sometimes unused and old Apps or other connections stay in that list.
If you want to clean this up, you need to do that by visiting the Amazon website and remove the devices there.

Link: https://www.amazon.de/hz/mycd/digital-console/devicedetails?deviceFamily=ALEXA_APP

After deleting an unused device, please restart the adapter to remove them there too.
