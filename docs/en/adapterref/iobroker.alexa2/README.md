**This adapter uses the service [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to automatically report exceptions and code errors and new device schemas to me as the developer.** More details see below!

This adapter allows you to remote control your Alexa (Amazon Echo) devices.

Big thanks go to soef for the version 1 of the adapter and to Hauke and ruhr70 for ideas in their scripts from ioBroker-Forum (especially the media progress updates)!
Also big thanks to to meicker for support in documenting all of this and numerous users from ioBroker Forum for their testing support!

| - | - | - |

| unpair | Button to unpair this device from the echo device |

### alexa2.0.Echo-Devices.Serialnumber.Commands.*
With Commands you can trigger some actions on your Alexa-Device. If you use these on a multiroom device then they are executed independently and *will not* run in sync on the single devices!

| State name | meaning | value |

Detailed information Speak and Announcement: Type in here what you want Alexa to say. You can also adjust the volume of Alexa by giving a percentage before your text.
Example: 10;Alexa is saying Alexa with 10% volume, while 100;Alexa is 100% volume.
Normally you only can send 250 characters per speak command. By using the semicolon it is possible to write as much as you want, as long as you separate 250 characters with a semicolon.
Alexa will then speak the text after each other with a small break. You also can use the volume together with more 255 blocks by writing #Volume;#Block1;#Block2, a.s.o A volume set here will be used over a defined speak-volume.

Partially also sounds from https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/ask-soundlibrary.html work. Specify in speak or ssml as `<audio src="soundbank://soundlibrary/animals/amzn_sfx_bear_groan_roar_01"/>`. Details and discussion please at https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/27509/ssml-audio

## Missing features
* how to update initial status for volume, shuffle or repeat and doNotDisturb?! Or unneeded?

* self deactivation if cookie/csrf invalid

## Installation
As usual using stable repository, latest repository or use the ioBroker "Install" options from GitHub


## Troubleshooting

### Problems with Cookie determination via E-Mail/Password
Sometimes Amazon has weired checks in place when they detect unexpected traffic on Login.
This can result in the problem that a captcha needs to be answered in order to login.
Mostly this captcha needs to be answered once and after this the login works without Captcha.

When you need to answer such a captcha then try to do the following:
* Use a common Browser (e.g. Chrome)
* disable Javascript!
* clear all cookies that may exist for Amazon or use Proivate/Incognito mode of the browser
* call https://alexa.amazon.de
* you should get a login form (normally displayed for older mobile browsers)
* login there with your Amazon credentials where the Echo/Alexa is registered in
* you may need to login twice or solve a Captcha
* At the end you should see "https://alexa.amazon.de/spa/index.html" as URL but without any real content (because JS is still disabled), BUT THIS IS COMPLETELY OK!!!!
* now try to get cookie again
* if it still not works do it again and check the User-Agent and accept-Language from your browser and use those in adapter on next try

Additionally the Accept-Language-Header (defaults to "de-DE") needs to match with your language/the browser language/the language of the amazon page you login.

You can also try to play around with the User-Agent and use one which more matches to the system type you use.
As example using "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36" as User-Agent was reported as working better when ioBroker runs on a linux system.

You can override all those parameters in the adapter configuration.

### How to determine Cookie by my own?
If the automatic Cookie determination don't work or you do not trust the Adapter to give the Email/Password then you can determine the cookie by your own. There are several infos on the web how to do it. Here some links:

* https://www.gehrig.info/alexa/Alexa.html
* or use the shellscript from https://blog.loetzimmer.de/2017/10/amazon-alexa-hort-auf-die-shell-echo.html to get it on shell ...

But be aware: The Cookie will time out after several time and then the adapter will stop working and disable itself. You then need to manually get a new cookie!

## What is Sentry.io and what is reported to the servers of that company?
Sentry.io is a service for developers to get an overview about errors from their applications. And exactly this is implemented in this adapter.

When the adapter crashes or an other Code error happens, this error message that also appears in the ioBroker log is submitted to Sentry. When you allowed iobroker GmbH to collect diagnostic data then also your installation ID (this is just a unique ID **without** any additional infos about you, email, name or such) is included. This allows Sentry to group errors and show how many unique users are affected by such an error. All of this helps me to provide error free adapters that basically never crashs.
