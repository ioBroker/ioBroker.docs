This adapter allows you to remote control your Alexa (Amazon Echo) devices.

Big thanks go to soef for the good version 1 of the adapter and to Hauke and ruhr70 for ideas in their scripts from ioBroker-Forum (especially the media progress updates)!
Also big thanks to to meicker for support in documenting all of this and numerous users from ioBroker Forum for their testing support!

## States and their meanings:

In the adapter namespace (e.g. alexa2.0) some channels are created

### alexa2.0

| State name | meaning |
| - | - |
| bespoken.* | Send text commands to a virtual device as if you would speak to it |
| echo-devices.* | States per Echo device, see below |
| history.* | Infos for command history, see below |
| smart-home-devices.* | States per smart home device and in general, see below |
| info.*| General information about the adapter status |
| requestResult | Error info for TuneIn and smart-home device requests |

### alexa2.0.Bespoken.*
Bespoken is normally a service provider to help automatically testing skills. But in fact you can use it to send commands to "your" Alexa/Amazon account. With this you can trigger skill actions that normally are not accessible via the Alexa App. By nature of the way it works only commands are possible that do not interact directly with the "Device you speak to", like normal commands that do a certain action and provide an answer. Playing Audio or Video or such that normally will be done by the device you spoke the command to will not work!

A Request to Bespoken will take some seconds because the sent text is first converted into audio, which is then send to Alexa Voice Services and is then answered by Alexa and send back. So it easiely can take up to 10s.

| State name | meaning |
| - | - |
| #sendText | Text to be send to the virtual device |
| answer | Answer from the device as text |
| anwserJson | Answer from the adapter as JSON, may contain additional informations like card infos or such |
| status | Status of the communication with bespoken (OK=Done/Wait for next command, PROCESSING=wait for answer from bespoken, FAILURE=Error happend while processing) |

### alexa2.0.Contacts.ContactId.*
All Alexa-Contacts that can be used to send Text Messages to, including himself. The own contact gets a special "(Self)" after his name.

| State name | meaning |
| - | - |
| #clearOwnMessages | Only exists in own contact and a trigger deletes all messages that are send to himself (also includes messages to himself via App or devices!) |
| textMessage | Sends this text as message to the user. It is shown on all devices of this user with a "yellow ring" |

### alexa2.0.Echo-Devices.Serialnumber.*
Under "echo-devices" every amazon echo device is listed with it's serial number. Not every device shows all the states. Every device has it's own states as described below:

### alexa2.0.Echo-Devices.Serialnumber.Alarm.*
Alarm (Wecker) settings for each device, if available.

| - | - | - |

Normally you only can send 250 characters per speak command. By using the semicolon it is possible to write as much as you want, as long as you separate 250 characters with a semicolon.
Alexa will then speak the text after each other with a small break. You also can use the volume together with more 255 blocks by writing #Volume;#Block1;#Block2, a.s.o A volume set here will be used over a defined speak-volume.

## Installation
As usual using stable repository, latest repository or use the ioBroker "Install" options from GitHub


## Troubleshooting

### Problems with Cookie determination via E-Mail/Password
Sometimes Amazon has weired checks in place when they detect unexpected traffic on Login.
This can result in the problem that a captcha needs to be answered in order to login.
Mostly this captcha needs to be answered once and after this the login works without Captcha.

When you need to answer such a captcha then try to do the following:
* Use a common Browser (e.g. Chrome)
* disable Javascript!
* clear all cookies that may exist for Amazon or use Proivate/Incognito mode of the browser
* call https://alexa.amazon.de
* you should get a login form (normally displayed for older mobile browsers)
* login there with your Amazon credentials where the Echo/Alexa is registered in
* you may need to login twice or solve a Captcha
* At the end you should see "https://alexa.amazon.de/spa/index.html" as URL but without any real content (because JS is still disabled), BUT THIS IS COMPLETELY OK!!!!
* now try to get cookie again
* if it still not works do it again and check the User-Agent and accept-Language from your browser and use those in adapter on next try

Additionally the Accept-Language-Header (defaults to "de-DE") needs to match with your language/the browser language/the language of the amazon page you login.

You can also try to play around with the User-Agent and use one which more matches to the system type you use.
As example using "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36" as User-Agent was reported as working better when ioBroker runs on a linux system.

You can override all those parameters in the adapter configuration.

### How to determine Cookie by my own?
If the automatic Cookie determination don't work or you do not trust the Adapter to give the Email/Password then you can determine the cookie by your own. There are several infos on the web how to do it. Here some links:

* https://www.gehrig.info/alexa/Alexa.html
* or use the shellscript from https://blog.loetzimmer.de/2017/10/amazon-alexa-hort-auf-die-shell-echo.html to get it on shell ...

But be aware: The Cookie will time out after several time and then the adapter will stop working and disable itself. You then need to manually get a new cookie!
