## opendtu adapter for ioBroker

This adapter get the data points from the project [OpenDTU](https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU) available in real time.  
In addition, the following data points can be used via the adapter to the power limitation of the OpenDTU can be controlled.

```
- opendtu.0.xxxxxx.power_control.limit_nonpersistent_absolute
- opendtu.0.xxxxxx.power_control.limit_nonpersistent_relative
- opendtu.0.xxxxxx.power_control.limit_persistent_absolute
- opendtu.0.xxxxxx.power_control.limit_persistent_relative  
```
For more information on the data points, see their description or click [here](https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU/blob/master/docs/MQTT_Topics.md#inverter-limit-specific-topics).

## Credits

This adapter would not have been possible without the great work of @o0Shojo0o (https://github.com/o0Shojo0o), who developed former releases of this adapter.

## How to report issues and feature requests

Ideally, please use GitHub issues for this, with the best method achieved by setting the adapter to Debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Then retrieve the logfile from disk via the  'log' ioBroker subdirectory, **not** from Admin, which will cut lines. 

## Configuration

1. Create a new instance of the adapter
2. Fill in Security *(default http)*, IP-Address and port *(default 80)* of the [OpenDTU](https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU) hardware 
3. Set the WebUI-Password **(this is mandatory, if it is incorrect no limit can be set!)**
4. Save the settings
