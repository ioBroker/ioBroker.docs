## Credits
This adapter is derived from the myVbus adapter and based on the work of by DutchmanNL and pdbjjens. Many thanks to both of them for their work.
Since pdbjjens only wanted to read values from vbus and for some people there is a need to get more control of their devices - this adapter was risen.
Here you get the ability to control your vbus controller.


## ioBroker Adapter for Resol VBus
This adapter connects various VBus-based devices to ioBroker supporting various connection types.

It's using resol-vbus, a JavaScript library provided by Daniel Wippermann.
Please visit <https://github.com/danielwippermann/resol-vbus>  if you're interested in a deeper dive. 

## Features

* Enables reading of the measurement data from various RESOL(R) VBus(R) devices - preferably solar and system controllers from the DeltaSol(R) series including built-in heat quantity meters (HQM) - using DL3 or DL2 data loggers, KM2 communication modules, VBus/LAN interface adapters or serial/LAN gateways locally via TCP/IP.
* Device access using the VBus/USB serial interface adapter or via VBus.net(R) using DLx/KMx is also supported.
* Processes live VBus data streams and makes them available as ioBroker states.
* Values are updated with a configurable cycle time.
* Reading or setting the VBus device configuration parameters is not supported. The tools provided by Resol should be used for this, e.g. via VBus.net or the parameterization tool RPT.
* Reading DL3 channel 0 (sensors directly connected to the DL3 device) is not supported due to limitations of the DL3 interface.

## Configuration hints

* The default setting for the connection type is VBus/LAN, but it must be explicitly selected even for VBus/LAN, otherwise no connection will be established.
* The correct settings for direct LAN access for VBus/LAN, DL3, DL2, KM2 are:
  * Connection type: VBus/LAN or KM2 or DL2 or DL3
  * Connection identifier: IP address (e.g. 192.168.178.188) or FullyQualifiedHostName (e.g. host1.example.com)
  * VBus password: YourVBusPassword (default: vbus)
  * Connection port: Default setting 7053 should not be changed
  * DL3 channel: Only relevant for DL3 (values 1-6, channel 0 can not be read out)
  * Update interval: Time between updates of the measured values (default 30s)
* The correct settings for the DL3, DL2, KM2 access via VBus.net are:
  * Connection type: vbus.net
  * Connection identifier: leave blank
  * Connection port: Default setting 7053 should not be changed
  * VBus password: YourVBusPassword (default: vbus)
  * DL3 channel: Only relevant for DL3 (values: 1-6, channel 0 cannot be read out)
  * Via identifier: Your Via-tag (e.g. d1234567890.vbus.io) - without http:// before
  * Update interval: Time between the update of the measured values (default 30s)

### Examples:
#### Connection via USB/Serial

| Operating System | Connectiondevice | Device-address      | Port | DL3-Channel | Via-Tag |   
|------------------|------------------|---------------------|------|-------------|---------|
| Windows          | USB/Serial       | COMx                |      | None        |         |
| Linux            |                  | /dev/tty.usbserial/ |      | None        |         |

#### Connection via LAN 
This includes: 
  * LAN
  * KM2 Devices
  * DL2 Devices 
  * DL3 Devices (Selection of Channel is important, Channel 0 is not supported)
  * Serial to LAN Gateways

|         | Connectiondevice             | Device-address            | Port           | DL3-Channel                         | Via-Tag     |   
|---------|------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
|         | select your Device from List | IP-Address of your Device | TCP Port       | DL3 Channel to use, when applicable | leave blank |
| Example | KM2                          | 192.168.17x.xxx           | 7053 (Default) | None                                |             | 
| Example | DL2                          | 192.168.17x.xxx           | 7053 (Default) | None                                |             | 
| Example | DL3                          | 192.168.17x.xxx           | 7053 (Default) | Channel x                           |             | 

#### Connection via vbus.net by Resol
You'll find your personal per device Via-tag on the vbus.net homepage under: My VBus.net - My devices.
Best is to copy/paste it from there - **without http://**
 
|                   | Connectiondevice          | Device-address | Port           | DL3-Channel | Via-Tag                          |   
|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
|                   | select vbus.net from List | leave blank    | TCP Port       | None        | your Via-tag from resol vbus.net |
| Example KM2 / DL2 | vbus.net                  |                | 7053 (Default) | None        | d01234567890.vbus.net            | 
| Example KM2 / DL2 | vbus.net                  |                | 7053 (Default) | None        | d01234567890.vbus.io             | 
| Example Dl3       | vbus.net                  |                | 7053 (Default) | Channel x   | d01234567890.vbus.io             | 
 
 
#### Sending commands to resol device

Edit the file of your controller you will find in the installed directory 'lib\resol-setup'

{"dp": [{"dpName":"Pumpe1","type":"number","min":0,"max":2},
	    {"dpName":"Pumpe2","type":"number","min":0,"max":2},
		{"dpName":"AutoRueckkuehl","type":"number","min":0,"max":1}
	   ],
	   
"fct": [{"name":"Pumpe1","cmd":"Handbetrieb1","val":"val"},
		{"name":"Pumpe2","cmd":"Handbetrieb2","val":"val"},
		{"name":"AutoRueckkuehl","cmds":[{"cmd":"ORueckkuehlung","val":"val"},{"cmd":"OHolyCool","val":"val"}]}
	   ]}
 
The items "dp" will be created after installing the adapter
The items "fct", "name" there is the link of the dpName. 
Example : If you change the value in the object "Pumpe1" then the adapter sends the command "Handbetrieb1" with the value to the resol device.
Also more than one command are possible. E.g. "AutoRueckkuehl"
 
#### How to add a new command 

e.g cooling for device resol cs plus

Please notice the device id in the resol objects (8721)
Open the selector file lib/resol-setup/Setup-Resol-Types.js and notice the line according to the device identifier
{"id":8721,"setup":"setup-resol-deltasol-cs-plus","data":"resol-deltasol-cs-plus-110-data"},
 
Open the file resol-deltasol-cs-plus-110-data.js in directory  resol-vbus/src/configuration-optimizers
Search in this file for 'ORueckkuehlung'

Open the file setup-resol-deltasol-cs-plus.js in directory lib/resol-setup/
Add a line in "dp" {"dpName":"Rueckkuehlung","type":"number","min":0,"max":1}
Add a line in "fct" {"name":"Rueckkuehlung","cmd":"ORueckkuehlung","val":"val"},

The file should look like this

{"dp": [{"dpName":"Pumpe1","type":"number","min":0,"max":2},
	    {"dpName":"Pumpe2","type":"number","min":0,"max":2},
		{"dpName":"Rueckkuehlung","type":"number","min":0,"max":1},
		{"dpName":"AutoRueckkuehl","type":"number","min":0,"max":1}
	   ],
	   
"fct": [{"name":"Pumpe1","cmd":"Handbetrieb1","val":"val"},
		{"name":"Pumpe2","cmd":"Handbetrieb2","val":"val"},
		{"name":"Rueckkuehlung","cmd":"ORueckkuehlung","val":"val"},
		{"name":"AutoRueckkuehl","cmds":[{"cmd":"ORueckkuehlung","val":"val"},{"cmd":"OHolyCool","val":"val"}]}
	   ]}
	   
Save the file and restart the adapter, you will find now a new object Rueckkuehlung.
