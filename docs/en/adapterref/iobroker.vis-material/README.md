material - Material widgets for ioBroker.vis.

You can read instructions in material.js, material.html files

These widgets are in addition to the material design style of Uhula, which you can find here:
[https://github.com/Uhula/ioBroker-Material-Design-Style](https://github.com/Uhula/ioBroker-Material-Design-Style)

The adapter uses CSS to set a black background and white as the font color. This means that it is only suitable for dark vis layouts.

In some installations, the font in the context menu may no longer be readable. This is probably caused by cross-effects from other adapters. To analyze these, please read the following post.
