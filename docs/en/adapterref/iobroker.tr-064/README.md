Based on this [AVM documentations](https://avm.de/service/schnittstellen/)

- turn on/off guest wifi,
- reboot Fritz!Box,
- start WPS process,
- reconnect Internet

### ring (dial a number)
- When using an internel number (like **610) the ring state will let ring that internal phone.
e.g.: **610[,timeout]
- When using an external number, the ring state will connect you to the external number.
 The FritzBox will call the external number and your default phone will ring, when the called phone is picked up.
 The default phone can be configured in the FritsBox under:
 Telefonie/Anrufe/[Tab]Wahlhilfe/WÃ¤hlhilfe verwenden

### toPauseState

- Resume can be done on the end value.

### Call monitor
The callmonitor will create realtime states for every inbound and outbound call.
If the phonebook is enabled (default), numbers will be resolved to Names

### Phonebook
- The phone book, if enabled, will be used to get the name of callers phone number.
- Further there are three states to resolve a number or a name. If available you will also get the image URL of the contact.
  e.g.: if you set the state phonebook.number all 3 states, name, number and image will be set to the found contact. Note, searches by     name will first compare the complete name, if not found, part of is used.

### Call lists
Output formats:
- json
- html

Call lists are:
- all calls
- missed calls
- inbound calls
- outbound calls

Call count:
The call count can be set to 0. The next call will incement 1.

The html output can be configured by a template

### command & commandResult state
With the command state you can call every tr-064 command from this [documentation](https://avm.de/service/schnittstellen/).
e.g.

```
command = {
    "service": "urn:dslforum-org:service:WLANConfiguration:1",
    "action": "X_AVM-DE_SetWPSConfig",
    "params": {
        "NewX_AVM-DE_WPSMode": "pbc",
        "NewX_AVM-DE_WPSClientPIN": ""
    }
};
```

The command state shoud be set to a JSON of the above Lines. So { ... } (without command = and line breaks)
The callback of the call will set the commandResult state.

### Enable call monitor
To use the call monitor feature it must be first enabled in the AVM Fritz!Box.
To enable the call monitor dial ```#96*5*```  and the TCP/IP Port 1012 will be opened. To close the port dial ```#96*4*```.
