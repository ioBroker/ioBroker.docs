This Adapter is able to receive [geofency](http://www.geofency.com/) events when entering or leaving a defined area with your mobile device.
All values of the geofency-webhook of the request are stored under the name of the location in ioBroker.

## configuration on mobile device:
* for any location -> properties -> webhook settings:
 * URL for entry & exit: &lt;your ioBroker Domain&gt;:&lt;configured port&gt;/&lt;any locationname&gt;
 * Post Format: JSON-encoded: enabled
 * authentication: set user / password from iobroker.geofency config

## security note:
It is not recommended to expose this adapter to the public internet.
Some kind of WAF/proxy/entry Server should be put before ioBroker. (e.g. nginx is nice and easy to configure).
