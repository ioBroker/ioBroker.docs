## What is Doorbird?

DoorBird is a door intercom that functions both as a doorbell and security system. The product goes on the outside of a house, where a doorbell would typically be, and features a doorbell push button with a camera above.

## Configuration

1. Enter the IP on which the Adapter should listen to Events from the Doorbird Device.
   (This is normally the IP of your ioBroker Host).
   The adapter tries to prefill the field with the correct IP for you. If the prefilled IP is not the IP of your ioBroker Host please change it to the correct IP.
2. The Port is predefined to `8100`. You can change it if the Port is already used by another service.
   Just try to run the Adapter with this Port. If the Port is not available you will get an error while starting the adapter. Then just get back here and change the port.
3. Enter the IP of your Doorbird device. You can click on the "search icon" left to the input field. After you clicked the icon a message at the top of the config screen will appear. Now you have 60 Seconds to press the ring button on your Doorbird device. The Adapter tries to detect the IP and fill all fields for you.
4. The Device ID (NOT IP!) of your Doorbird.
5. The Username which needs to have the **API-Operator** and **Watch always** permissions on the Doorbird device.
6. The password for the Username entered in field 5.

After you entered all required information to the config dialog click "Save & Close".
The Adapter should now restart, and you are ready to go!
