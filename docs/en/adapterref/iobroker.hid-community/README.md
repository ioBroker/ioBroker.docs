## Description
Adapter for HID devices e.g. Apple Remote

## Initial Creation
This adapter was initialy created by @soef at https://github.com/soef/ioBroker.hid but not maintained any more, so we moved it to iobroker-community so that bugs could be fixed. thanks @soef for his work.

## Installation
Please install bia Admin

It can be that the following additional things are needed
* **prepare permissions**: execute `iob fix` 
* **Install additional packages**: `sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev`
* **Setting proper rights**: If the device can not be opened please look at https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid#udev-device-permissions

## States
There are two state groups, raw and key. the key group will only be fired, is a mapping is found.

Only one of the states xxx.double, xxx.single and xxx.long will change on an event.
The state xxx.dsl gets the results .double, single or long.
Action indicates down, up or repeat.

## Mappings
Add or edit the mapping section in the io-package.json file to see the names of the key codes. 
This is not necessary, the raw data states will be created anyway. 
```
  "mappings": {
    "26017F2A55": "AllLightsOn-(AM)",
    "26017F1867": "AllLightsOff-(Memory)",
    "26857A21DE": "OK",
    "26857A55AA": "ESC"
  },
```

#### Requirements

The node-hid module does not work on Windows 10 until you make a smal change to the node-hid project.
After installation of iobroker.hid-community edit:
```
<path to iobroker>/node_modules/iobroker.hid-community/node_modules/node-hid/hidapi/windows/hid.c
```
Find:
```
open_device
```
Change the 2nd and 3rd parameter of the function call "CreateFileA":
```
static HANDLE open_device(const char *path, BOOL enumerate)
{
    ... 
      
	handle = CreateFileA(path,
		//desired_access,                    // original line
		GENERIC_WRITE | GENERIC_READ,        // replaced line
		//share_mode,                        // original line
		FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE,  // replaced line
		NULL,
		OPEN_EXISTING,
		FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED,/*FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,*/
		0);

	...	
}
```
