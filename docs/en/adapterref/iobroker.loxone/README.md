***This adapter requires at least nodejs 4.x!***

Fetches all information available in Loxone Miniserver (and Loxone Miniserver Go) and provides changes in realtime.

## Install

Install this adapter via ioBroker Admin:
1. Open instance config dialog
2. Enter the IP address or host name and HTTP port (80 by default) of your Loxone Miniserver
3. Create a new user in the Loxone Miniserver (using the Loxone Config application) to which you only give read and write rights to all required variables.
4. Enter this user's name and its password in the config dialog
5. Save the configuration
6. Start the adapter

## Configuration

### Miniserver Hostname / IP

This is the IP address or host name of your Loxone Miniserver or Miniserver Go.

### Miniserver Port

This is the HTTP port of your Loxone Miniserver.

By default the Miniserver is configured to listen on port 80, but you might have changed it.

### Miniserver Username

Provide a valid username to access the Loxone Miniserver.

It is strongly suggested to use a user different from "admin" for security reasons.

The user only needs read access to the variables you want to use from ioBroker.

### Miniserver Password

Provide the password for the given username (see above).

Please be aware that this password is stored unsecured inside ioBroker - therefore don't use the "admin" user!

### Synchronize Names

This will update names in ioBroker whenever they change in the Loxone configuration.
If this is disabled, names will only be synchronized the first time a control is detected.

### Synchronize Rooms

This will populate the enum.rooms enumeration with all rooms provided by the Loxone Miniserver and will link all controls.

### Synchronize Functions

This will populate the enum.functions enumeration with all categories provided by the Loxone Miniserver and will link all controls.

## States

The adapter automatically connects to the configured Loxone Miniserver and creates states for each control state it finds.

The IDs of the states are formatted like this: `loxone.<instance>.<control>.<state>`
- `<instance>` is the ioBroker adapter instance index (usually "0")
- `<control>` is the UUID of the control
- `<state>` is the state within the control (see [Supported Control Types](#supported-control-types) for more information).

The name provided when configuring a control in Loxone Config will only be used as its display name in ioBroker.
This is because a user may choose the same name for multiple controls.

For more information about controls and their states, please also have a look at the Loxone API (especially the Structure File): https://www.loxone.com/enen/kb/api/

## Control Visibility

By default Loxone Miniserver hides many controls (and thus their states) from the Web interface.

That means, they are also hidden from this ioBroker adapter.

To ensure, all your states are properly reported to ioBroker, please verify that they have "Use in Visualization" checked:

![Use in Visualization settings](doc/loxone-config-use-in-visualization.png)

## Global States

The following global states are currently provided by this adapter:
- `operatingMode`: the current operating mode number of the Loxone Miniserver
- `operatingMode-text`: the current operating mode of the Loxone Miniserver as text
- `sunrise`: the number of minutes after midnight when the sun rises today
- `sunset`: the number of minutes after midnight when the sun goes down today
- `notifications`: the number of notifications
- `modifications`: the number of modifications
- all other global states are simply reported as texts

## Supported Control Types

The following control types are currently supported by this adapter.

Behind the name of the state, you can see the type of the state:
- `(rw)`: readable and writable: this state can be changed from ioBroker
- `(ro)`: read-only: this state can't be changed from ioBroker
- `(wo)`: write-only: this state's value isn't reported by this adapter, but it can be changed, triggering some action on the Loxone Miniserver
