**Tests:** ![Test and Release](https://github.com/UncleSamSwiss/ioBroker.loxone/workflows/Test%20and%20Release/badge.svg)

## loxone adapter for ioBroker

**_This adapter requires at least nodejs 10.x!_**

Fetches all information available in Loxone Miniserver (and Loxone Miniserver Go) and provides changes in realtime.

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Install

Install this adapter via ioBroker Admin:

1. Open instance config dialog
2. Enter the IP address or host name and HTTP port (80 by default) of your Loxone Miniserver
3. Create a new user in the Loxone Miniserver (using the Loxone Config application) to which you only give read and write rights to all required variables.
4. Enter this user's name and its password in the config dialog
5. Save the configuration
6. Start the adapter

## Configuration

### Miniserver Hostname / IP

This is the IP address or host name of your Loxone Miniserver or Miniserver Go.

### Miniserver Port

This is the HTTP port of your Loxone Miniserver.

By default the Miniserver is configured to listen on port 80, but you might have changed it.

### Miniserver Username

Provide a valid username to access the Loxone Miniserver.

It is strongly suggested to use a user different from "admin" for security reasons.

The user only needs read access to the variables you want to use from ioBroker.

### Miniserver Password

Provide the password for the given username (see above).

### Synchronize Names

This will update names in ioBroker whenever they change in the Loxone configuration.
If this is disabled, names will only be synchronized the first time a control is detected.

### Synchronize Rooms

This will populate the enum.rooms enumeration with all rooms provided by the Loxone Miniserver and will link all controls.

### Synchronize Functions

This will populate the enum.functions enumeration with all categories provided by the Loxone Miniserver and will link all controls.

### Weather Server

Choose what weather data you wish to synchronize:

-   "Don't synchronize weather data" will not synchronize anything related to the Weather Server
-   "Synchronize current weather only" will synchronize the data under "Actual"
-   "Synchronize 24 hours of weather forcast" will synchronize the current weather and 24 hours of weather forcast
-   "Synchronize entire weather forcast" will synchronize the current weather and the entire weather forcast (96 hours)

## States

The adapter automatically connects to the configured Loxone Miniserver and creates states for each control state it finds.

The IDs of the states are formatted like this: `loxone.<instance>.<control>.<state>`

-   `<instance>` is the ioBroker adapter instance index (usually "0")
-   `<control>` is the UUID of the control
-   `<state>` is the state within the control (see [Supported Control Types](#supported-control-types) for more information).

The name provided when configuring a control in Loxone Config will only be used as its display name in ioBroker.
This is because a user may choose the same name for multiple controls.

For more information about controls and their states, please also have a look at the Loxone API (especially the Structure File): https://www.loxone.com/enen/kb/api/

## Control Visibility

By default Loxone Miniserver hides many controls (and thus their states) from the Web interface.

That means, they are also hidden from this ioBroker adapter.

### Use in User Interface

To ensure, all your states are properly reported to ioBroker, please verify that they have "Use" in the "User Interface" section checked:

![Use in User Interface settings](doc/loxone-config-use-in-visualization.png)

### Display diagnostic inputs

To see diagnostic inputs (e.g. battery status of Air devices), please verify that the device has "Display diagnostic inputs" checked:

![Display diagnostic inputs settings](doc/loxone-config-display-diagnostics.png)

## Global States

The following global states are currently provided by this adapter:

-   `operatingMode`: the current operating mode number of the Loxone Miniserver
-   `operatingMode-text`: the current operating mode of the Loxone Miniserver as text
-   `sunrise`: the number of minutes after midnight when the sun rises today
-   `sunset`: the number of minutes after midnight when the sun goes down today
-   `notifications`: the number of notifications
-   `modifications`: the number of modifications
-   all other global states are simply reported as texts

## Supported Control Types

The following control types are currently supported by this adapter.

Behind the name of the state, you can see the type of the state:

-   `(rw)`: readable and writable: this state can be changed from ioBroker
-   `(ro)`: read-only: this state can't be changed from ioBroker
-   `(wo)`: write-only: this state's value isn't reported by this adapter, but it can be changed, triggering some action on the Loxone Miniserver

## Weather Server

The weather server information is provided as a device with multiple channels.
The device is called `WeatherServer`.
It contains:

-   the channel `Actual` with the current weather values
-   one channel for each forecast hour called `HourXX` where `XX` is the number of hours from now

Every channel contains the following states:

-   `barometricPressure`: numeric barometric pressure value
-   `barometricPressure-formatted`: formatted barometric pressure value with unit
-   `dewPoint`: numeric dew point value
-   `dewPoint-formatted`: formatted dew point value with unit
-   `perceivedTemperature`: numeric perceived temperature value
-   `perceivedTemperature-formatted`: formatted perceived temperature value with unit
-   `precipitation`: numeric precipitation value
-   `precipitation-formatted`: formatted precipitation value with unit
-   `relativeHumidity`: numeric relative humidity value
-   `relativeHumidity-formatted`: formatted relative humidity value with unit
-   `solarRadiation`: solar radiation value
-   `temperature`: numeric temperature value
-   `temperature-formatted`: formatted temperature value with unit
-   `timestamp`: timestamp of the data as `value.time` (JavaScript time)
-   `weatherType`: numeric weather type enumeration value
-   `weatherType-text`: text representation of the weather type
-   `windDirection`: wind direction value
-   `windSpeed`: wind speed value
-   `windSpeed-formatted`: formatted wind speed value with unit

## Unsupported Control Types

When Loxone adds new control types, they are most often not immediately supported by this adapter.

In this case, the control will have "Unknown:" in front of its name. E.g. `Unknown: Wallbox`

Those controls will contain all states reported by the Miniserver, but they will all be read-only strings.

If you need better support for a new control type, please follow the steps in the next section to requeset a new feature.

**Sentry:** unsupported control types will be reported to the developers using Sentry. This way you might get new controls in the next release without having to request it yourself.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Please use the GitHub repository to report any bugs or request new features.

If you require an unsupported control type, please provide the name as it is reported in the error log of ioBroker as well as the entire raw contents of the device in the ioBroker object tree:

Log file example for "LightController":
