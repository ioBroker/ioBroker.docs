## Overview

The ioBroker AI Assistant Adapter runs a smart assistant in your ioBroker system. The assistant can be used to interact with your ioBroker system, set time-based instructions, trigger-based instructions, and call custom functions. The assistant can be configured with different language models from various providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, OpenRouter) or custom/self-hosted models. The assistant can be used to automate tasks, control your smart home, or provide information.

## Features

- Personalize the name and personality of your assistant
- List, Read and Write ioBroker states
- Set timeouts and cronjobs to run time based instructions
- Set triggers on ioBroker states with conditions that run instructions when the conditions are met
- Define custom functions with your own data and logic

## Supported Providers

- **Anthropic**: [anthropic.com](https://anthropic.com)
- **OpenAI**: [openai.com](https://openai.com)
- **Perplexity**: [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai)

| **Debug / CoT Output** | When active the internal thoughts and processes the assistant uses are written to the text_response state. |
| **Message History**    | Include prior messages (for chatbot-like behavior). Set to 0 for single-use tools to minimize token usage. |
| **Temperature**        | Controls response creativity/consistency.                                                                  |

### Objects

### WARNING: Be careful with the states you give the assistant access to, as it can read and write to all states it has access to.

Setup the ioBrokers objects and states the assistant should have access to. 

**NOTE: When importing or adding objects please make sure to only add datapoints with the type "state" that can be directly controlled or contains a value to be read!**

| **Setting**                | **Description**                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Import from Enum.Rooms** | Imports all your states from the enum.rooms sorting in ioBroker. (Overwrites all previously set objects!) |
| **Sort**                   | All objects with the same sort field will be presented to the assistant in a group (e.g. a room)          |
| **Name**                   | Use a descriptive name so the assistant understands the function of the objects                           |
| **Object**                 | The ID of the ioBroker state                                                                              |

---

### Functions

Setup custom functions that should be available to the assistant.
Your custom functions have to write the response to the state you defined in the `State (Response)` field after the `State (Request)` is written.
The result can be in any format you like (e.g. JSON, plain text), just make sure the assistant can understand it.
Tipp: You can use the [AI-Toolbox Adapter](https://github.com/ToGe3688/ioBroker.ai-toolbox) to integrate your assistant with custom AI tools.

**NOTE: If you don't write a response to the `State (Response)` field in 60 Seconds, the function call will fail!**

| **Setting**          | **Description**                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sort**             | All objects with the same sort field will be presented to the assistant in a group (e.g. a room) |
| **Name**             | Use a descriptive name for the custom function                                                   |
| **Description**      | Describe what your function does so the assistant understands when to call it                    |
| **State (Request)**  | This state will be written with a string by the assistant when the function is called            |
| **State (Response)** | This state will be read by the assistant to get the response of the function                     |

## Usage

### Simple Conversation

You can interact with your assistant by sending text requests to the `text_request` state and receiving responses from the `text_response` state.

#### Function Calling

The assistant can call all available functions. It does this by determining the function to call based on the text request. If you have Debug/CoT Output enabled, you can see the internal process of the assistant in the `text_response` state.

#### State Interaction

The assistant can list, read and write multiple ioBroker states at once. You can use the `Objects` tab to define which states the assistant should have access to.

#### Time-based Instructions

The assistant can set timeouts for relative time instructions and cronjobs for specific times. Cronjobs will be listed in the assistant objects tree unter `Cronjobs`.
Timeouts will only be temporary and will be removed after the the timeout is executed or the adapter is restarted.
When a timeout or cronjob is triggered the assistant will be woken up and the instruction will be executed.

#### Trigger-based Instructions

The assistant can set triggers on ioBroker states with optional conditions that run instructions when the conditions are met. Triggers will be listed in the assistant objects tree unter `Triggers`.
When triggered the assistant will be woken up and the instruction will be executed.

#### Custom Functions

The assistant can call custom functions you defined in the `Functions` tab. The assistant will write the request to the `State (Request)` field and expects the response in the `State (Response)` field.

#### Function Chaining

The assistant can be used to chain multiple functions together. For example you could setup a cronjob that when executed starts a check of ioBroker states and then calls a custom function with the results.

#### Clearing Chat History

Sometimes it can be useful to reset your chat history. You can do this by requesting the assistant to clear its history. This will remove all previous messages from the assistant's memory. (e.g. `Clear history` or `Forget the previous messages`)

## Additional Information

### Statistics

Statistics are logged for your assistant and can be viewed in the `Statistics` object tree.

| **Datapoint**                    | **Description**                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **.statistics.lastRequest**      | Timestamp of the last request.                          |
| **.statistics.requestCount**     | Number of sent requests to the assistant                |
| **.statistics.messages\***       | JSON array of message history (if message history > 0). |
| **.statistics.clear_messages\*** | Clear message history button.                           |
| **.statistics.tokens_input**     | Total input tokens used.                                |
| **.statistics.tokens_output**    | Total output tokens used.                               |
