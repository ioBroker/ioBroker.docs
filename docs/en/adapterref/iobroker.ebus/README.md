**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** 
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

This adapter reads
- data from ebusd using html
In this case ebusd must run and must be able to send data to e.g. explorer via http://IP:port/data (http://192.168.0.123:8889/data)
Current version of ebusd incl. configuration files can be copied from https://github.com/john30/ebusd
All fields with data, lastup and from global section are parsed. All others are ignored at the moment. 

There is a possibillity to poll data which are not polled by ebusd directly. Command 'read -f' is used to force reading over ebus.  

Another feature is to send any command to ebusd and receive answer to work with e.g. scripts.

current supported ebusd-version: 3.3
