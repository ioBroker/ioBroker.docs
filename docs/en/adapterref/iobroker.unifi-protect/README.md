**This adapter uses the service [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to automatically report exceptions and code errors and new device schemas to me as the developer.** More details see below!

## unifi-protect adapter for ioBroker

Connects to Unifi Protect Controller and pulls all Data from added Cameras.

Standard Ports if not changed by yourself:
 - Cloud Key Plus Gen2: 7443
 - UDM Pro: 443


## Examples for getThumbnail and getSnapshot

```
// Settings
const path = '/opt/iobroker/tmp/temp.jpg';
const threshold = 50;

// Send to Telegram ( or what you prefer )
function sendImage(path) {
    sendTo('telegram.0', path);
}

//Trigger Script
on({ id: 'unifi-protect.0.motions.lastMotion.thumbnail', change: "ne" }, function () {
    const thumb = getState('unifi-protect.0.motions.lastMotion.thumbnail'/*thumbnail*/).val;
    const end = getState('unifi-protect.0.motions.lastMotion.end'/*thumbnail*/).val;
    const cameraid = getState('unifi-protect.0.motions.lastMotion.camera'/*thumbnail*/).val;
    const score = getState('unifi-protect.0.motions.lastMotion.score'/*thumbnail*/).val;
    if (score < threshold) { return; }
    // if Event has ended send the Thumbnail otherwise get current Snapshot
    if (end != null) {
        sendTo('unifi-protect.0', 'getThumbnail', { "thumbnail": thumb, "path": path }, function (res) {
            sendImage(path);
        });
    } else {
        sendTo('unifi-protect.0', 'getSnapshot', { "cameraid": cameraid, "path": path }, function (res) {
            sendImage(path);
        });
    }
});
```

```
sendTo('unifi-protect.0', 'getSnapshot', { "cameraid": "5e4a861c01d12503870003f9", "path": path }, function (res) {
    sendImage(path);
});
```

## What is Sentry.io and what is reported to the servers of that company?
Sentry.io is a service for developers to get an overview about errors from their applications. And exactly this is implemented in this adapter.

When the adapter crashes or an other Code error happens, this error message that also appears in the ioBroker log is submitted to Sentry. When you allowed iobroker GmbH to collect diagnostic data then also your installation ID (this is just a unique ID **without** any additional infos about you, email, name or such) is included. This allows Sentry to group errors and show how many unique users are affected by such an error. All of this helps me to provide error free adapters that basically never crashs.
