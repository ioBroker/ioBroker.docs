# ioBroker.viessmannapi
 =================

This adapter connects your ioBroker system to your Viessmann central heating via the Viessmann API. It requires your heating system to be connected to the Viessmann Server via a Vitoconnect or similar device. All enabled information provided by the API is polled periodically (every 60 sec) and written into states.

Note that this is a private project, so use at your own risk. It is not supported or endorsed by Viessmann!

## Installation
As this adapter is in an early development stage, installation can be done via the ioBroker 'latest' repository. On adapter settings, enter user name and password of your Viessmann account. If everything goes well, you should see states appear under `viessmannapi.X`. First values should arrive after 60 seconds.

## States
The specific states may depend on your installation. Examples are
- `viessmannapi.0.heating.boiler.sensors.temperature.main.value` - boiler temperature
- `viessmannapi.0.heating.circuits.0.heating.curve.shift` and `slope` - shift and slope determining the heating curve
- `viessmannapi.0.heating.circuits.0.operating.modes.active.value` - current operating mode; for example `dhw` means hot water only, `dhwAndHeating` means hot water and heating
- `viessmannapi.0.heating.sensors.temperature.outside.value` - outside temperature measured by the external sensor

## Actions
Some features provide *actions* to change some property. An action can be invoked via the `sendTo` method. The syntax looks like this:
```javascript
sendTo('viessmannapi.0', 'action', {
    feature: 'heating.circuits.0.operating.programs.comfort',
    action: 'setTemperature',
    payload: {targetTemperature: 20}
});
```
Above call would set the target temperature for the comfort program to 20Â°C. 

### Supported Actions
Below is a list of supported actions (note, that depending on your heating installation, some actions may not be available, or other actions are available but not documented here).

### Schedule Type
Most actions use simple data types (numbers, strings). Some actions allow setting schedules. A schedule looks like this:
```javascript
{
   "mon":[
      {
         "start":"05:30",
         "end":"10:00",
         "mode":"on",
         "position":0
      },
      {
          "start":"11:00",
          "end":"12:30",
          "mode":"on",
          "position":1
      },
      /* ... */
   ],
   "tue":[ /* ... */ ],
   "wed":[ /* ... */ ],
   "thu":[ /* ... */ ],
   "fri":[ /* ... */ ],
   "sat":[ /* ... */ ],
   "sun":[ /* ... */ ]
}
```

For each day, an array must be provided containing the "schedules" for this day. A single entry consists of start and end time, the scheduled "mode" and the position. The supported modes depend on what is scheduled, see table of supported features above. Outside of the scheduled elements, the default mode is used, see the table above. In the example above, something is scheduled to be "on" on monday between 5:30 and 10:00 and betwenn 11:00 and 12:30. Outside of these time intervals, the default mode ("off") is scheduled.

### Querying all features
To get a list of all available features with all available actions, simply send the message `describe` to a running adapter instance. The result is an array of all available features, that for example can be printed as JSON string via `JSON.stringify()`.

*Example:*
```javascript
sendTo('viessmannapi.0', 'describe', {}, (result) => {
    const features = JSON.stringify(result.result);
    log(features);
});
```
This script queries all available features and prints them into the log.
