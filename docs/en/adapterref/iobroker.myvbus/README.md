## ioBroker Adapter for Resol VBus

This adapter connects ioBroker to various VBus-based devices using resol-vbus, a JavaScript library for the acquisition of RESOL VBus data, provided by Daniel Wippermann.

<https://github.com/danielwippermann/resol-vbus>

<https://www.npmjs.com/package/resol-vbus>

## Features

* Enables reading of the measurement data from various RESOL(R) VBus(R) devices - preferably solar and system controllers from the DeltaSol(R) series including built-in heat quantity meters (HQM) - using DL3 or DL2 data loggers, KM2 communication modules, VBus/LAN interface adapters or serial/LAN gateways locally via TCP/IP.
* Device access using the VBus/USB serial interface adapter or via VBus.net(R) using DLx/KMx is also supported.
* Processes live VBus data streams and makes them available as ioBroker states.
* Values are updated with a configurable cycle time.
* Reading or setting the VBus device configuration parameters is not supported. The tools provided by Resol should be used for this, e.g. via VBus.net or the parameterization tool RPT.  
A derived version of this adapter supporting control of VBus devices is available at <https://github.com/Grizzelbee/ioBroker.resol>
* Reading DL3 channel 0 (sensors directly connected to the DL3 device) is not supported due to limitations of the DL3 interface.

## Configuration hints

* The connection device type e.g. VBus/LAN or DL2. Must be explicitly selected, otherwise no connection will be established.
* TCP connection port: Only relevant or LAN-based access. The default setting 7053 should not be changed
* Device password: The password which you have set in your connection device (default: vbus)
* DL3 channel: Only relevant for DL3/DL2Plus - leave at "None" for all other connection devices.  
(allowed values: 1-6, channel 0 cannot be read out)
* Via Tag: Only relevant for DL3, DL2, KM2 access via VBus.net - leave blank for all other connection devices.
* Update interval: The time between updates of the measured values (default 30s)
* The correct settings for direct serial interface access for VBus/USB are:
  * Connection Device: VBus/USB
  * Device Address: The path to the serial port to which the serial interface adapter is connected like  
  '/dev/ttyUSB0' or  
  '/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_USB-Modul_UO2102_TDEB6I8DAVDLGAGC-if00-port0' or  
  '/dev/serial/by-path/platform-fd500000.pcie-pci-0000:01:00.0-usb-0:1.4.1:1.0-port0' for Linux or  
  'COM5' for Windows-based ioBroker platforms
* The correct settings for direct LAN access for VBus/LAN, DL3, DL2, KM2 are:
  * Connection Device: VBus/LAN or KM2/DL2 or DL3/DL2Plus
  * Device Address: IP address (e.g. 192.168.178.188) or FullyQualifiedHostName (e.g. myKM2.fritz.box)
* The correct settings for the DL3, DL2, KM2 access via VBus.net are:
  * Connection Device: DL3/DL2Plus or DL2/KM2
  * Device Address: vbus.net (or vbus.io) - both without http:// and Via identifier!  
  * Via Tag: YourViaIdentifier (e.g. d1234567890) - without http:// before or .vbus.io behind
