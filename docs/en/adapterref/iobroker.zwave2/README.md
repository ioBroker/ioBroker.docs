<h2 align="center">Z-Wave for ioBroker. But better.</h3>

Z-Wave 2 is a brand new Z-Wave implementation for ioBroker. It is based on [`zwave-js`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-zwave-js), which was written from the ground up for your benefit.

Unless [`ioBroker.zwave`](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.zwave/) it does not require `OpenZWave`. This means that the installation and updates are fast, and no compilation of static libraries and other complicated steps are necessary.

Furthermore, some devices just don't work in the original adapter, e.g. the Fibaro Roller Shutter 3.

Easy usage in ioBroker was kept in mind during the whole development. For example, some devices reuse configuration parameters to configure many different things. In this adapter, most of them are split into separate states and no complicated math is necessary:

[Older changes](CHANGELOG_OLD.md)
<!--
	Placeholder for next versions:
	### __WORK IN PROGRESS__
-->
### 2.4.5 (2022-02-20)
* Update `zwave-js` to `8.11.6`
* After healing, battery-powered nodes are sent back to sleep again
* Added a workaround for thermostats that don't advertise all their supported thermostat modes. When such a thermostat enters such an "unsupported" mode, the mode is now dynamically added to the list of supported modes.
* New and updated configuration files, see [Z-Wave JS releases](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases) for details

### 2.4.3 (2022-01-18)
* Updated translations
* Updated `zwave-js` from `8.9.1` to `8.11.2`. Check out the [releases](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases) for a detailed overview over the new and changed configuration files.
* Add support for `Humidity Control Mode CC`
* Add support for `Humidity Control Operating State CC`
* Add support for `Humidity Control Setpoint CC`
* Work around an issue where some devices could not be interviewed due to an incorrect `Version CC` response.
* Fixed an issue where `Supervision Get` requests were not answered for sleeping nodes
* Re-interviewing sleeping nodes now only resets the known information when the node wakes up
* The `colors` dependency was recently [corrupted on purpose](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/9/22874949/developer-corrupts-open-source-libraries-projects-affected). This patch updates all dependencies that depended on an affected version, directly or indirectly.

### 2.4.2 (2021-12-23)
* Fix: Additional node-related commands now respect and update the node status
* Fixed an issue where the communication could get stuck after aborting a command
* New and updated configuration files, see [here](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v8.9.0) and [here](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v8.9.1)

### 2.4.2-beta.1 (2021-12-17)
* Fixed the check for incomplete or incorrect value IDs

### 2.4.2-beta.0 (2021-12-16)
* Experimental: The handling of messages has been rewritten from scratch and simplified. This may cause some unintended behavior.
* Avoid interruption of the communication with a node by other nodes requesting responses from the controller
* Improved reliability of encrypted communication
* Battery-powered devices are nore sent to sleep more reliably
* Fixed encoding of some configuration parameters
* Fix: Limit allowed Node.js versions to `12.22.2+`, `14.13.0+`, `16+` and forbid installation on development Node.js versions
* Fixed some crashes
* Fixed an issue where healing the network would fail due to a too low timeout
* Improved detection of sticks that do not support soft reset
* New and updated configuration files, see [here](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v8.8.0) and [here](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v8.9.0-beta.3)
