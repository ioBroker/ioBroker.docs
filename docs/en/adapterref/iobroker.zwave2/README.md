<h2 align="center">Z-Wave for ioBroker. But better.</h3>

Z-Wave 2 is a brand new Z-Wave implementation for ioBroker. It is based on [`zwave-js`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-zwave-js), which was written from the ground up for your benefit.

Unless [`ioBroker.zwave`](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.zwave/) it does not require `OpenZWave`. This means that the installation and updates are fast, and no compilation of static libraries and other complicated steps are necessary.

Furthermore, some devices just don't work in the original adapter, e.g. the Fibaro Roller Shutter 3.

Easy usage in ioBroker was kept in mind during the whole development. For example, some devices reuse configuration parameters to configure many different things. In this adapter, most of them are split into separate states and no complicated math is necessary:

* Hardened the checks to prevent simultaneous write-accesses for the cache files
* The adapter should now be restarted when the serial connection is disconnected
* Fixed a bug where associatiations on endpoints had incorrect labels
* Updated dependencies
* Tons of new and improved config files

* Endpoints of multi channel devices should now always be queried with the correct CC version
* Throttled some automatic queries
* Avoid a situation where multiple instances of the adapter try to access the same cache files, potentially corrupting them
