## zwave2 adapter for ioBroker

Alternative Z-Wave implementation

## Changelog
<!-- 
	Placeholder for next versions:
	### __WORK IN PROGRESS__
-->

### 0.10.0 (2020-02-13)
* Updated `zwave-js` to v2.13.3 to improve support for older `Multi Channel` devices
* Added an *actions* dialog to the device overview, which allows performing node-specific actions. The first available action is removing failed nodes.
* Added a `ready` state for nodes which can be used in scripts to check if the node is ready to accept commands
* Value that are set to `undefined` are now converted to `null` before being passed to ioBroker. This avoids a bug in the javascript adapter where triggers would be called with wrong state values.

### 0.9.6 (2020-02-10)
Updated `zwave-js` to v2.13.2. This includes the following fixes:
* Improved support for older devices with multiple endpoints
* The *HeatIt Z-Push Button 8* should now correctly be detected
* Potential fix for weird behavior of Start Level Change commands in some devices.

### 0.9.5 (2020-02-07)
Updated `zwave-js` to v2.13.0. This includes the following changes:
* Improved support for some notifications types

### 0.9.4 (2020-02-02)
* Small performance improvements
* Fixed an error that could happen when a state was changed before the driver is ready
* Updated `zwave-js` to v2.12.3. This includes the following changes:

	* Improved handling of nodes that don't respond to a request
	* Minor stability improvements and bugfixes

### 0.9.3 (2020-01-26)
* Updated `zwave-js` to v2.12.2. This should fix issues with older Thermostats.

### 0.9.2 (2020-01-25)
Updated `zwave-js` to v2.12.1. This includes the following changes:

### 0.7.1 (2020-01-03)
