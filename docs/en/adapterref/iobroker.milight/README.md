adapter for ioBroker for LED-lamps like milight, easybulb, limitless

## Installation:
from npm
```javascript
npm install iobroker.milight
```
actual version from github
```javascript
npm install https://github.com/foxthefox/ioBroker.milight/tarball/master --production
```
## common Settings:
in admin page
* IP-Adress-> IP of bridge
* Port -> port of bridge
* delaybetweenPackages -> ms delay between UDP packages (100ms for v5)
* repeatPackage -> number of repetitions (1 for v5)
* version of the milight protocol v5 or v6 -> sets automatically the corresponding port
* setting full brightness when changed to white mode 

## type of bulbs in the zones:
in admin page
* basic = bridge ONLY for zone 1 and v6
* RGBWW = full color bulb with white LED and color temperature adjustment (increase color temp means cooler coloring), ONLY in v6
* RGB = pure color bulb without white ONLY for zone 1
* RGBW = color bulb with white LED
* White = WW/CW white bulb with color temperature adjustment (increase color temp means cooler coloring)

The Zone0 or ZoneAll can be used to give commands to all 4 zones, the adapter is configured in v6 with base/bridge commands and in v5 with rgbw commands.
