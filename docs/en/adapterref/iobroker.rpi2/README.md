**Tests:** ![Test and Release](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.rpi2/workflows/Test%20and%20Release/badge.svg)
RPI-Monitor implementation for integration into ioBroker. It is the same implementation as for iobroker.rpi, but with GPIOs.

## Important Information
Works only with node >= 18

**ioBroker needs special permissions to control GPIOs.** On most Linux distributions this can be achieved by adding the ioBroker user to the `gpio` group (recommended) or running ioBroker under `root` (less secure).

For gpio to work, you need to install libgpiod, **before** installing the adapter, like this: `sudo apt-get install -y libgpiod-dev`

## Installation
After installation you have to configure all required modules via administration page.

After start of iobroker.rpi, all selected modules generates
an object tree in ioBroker within rpi.<instance>.<modulename>
e.g. rpi.0.cpu

Be sure, that python and build-essential are installed:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python
sudo apt-get install -y libgpiod-dev
```
(the last one is only necessary, if you want to work with GPIOs)

Following Objects are available after selection:

#### **CPU**

- cpu_frequency
- load1
- load5
- load15

#### **Raspberry (vcgencmd is required)**

- cpu_voltage
- mem_arm
- mem_gpu

#### **Memory**

- memory_available
- memory_free
- memory_total

#### **Network (eth0)**
- net_received
- net_send

#### **SDCard**
- sdcard_boot_total
- sdcard_boot_used
- sdcard_root_total
- sdcard_root_used

#### **Swap**
- swap_total
- swap_used

#### **Temperature**
- soc_temp

#### **Uptime**
- uptime

#### **WLAN**
- wifi_received
- wifi_send

## Configuration
On configuration page you can select following modules:

- CPU
- Raspberry
- Memory
- Network
- SDCard
- Swap
- Temperature
- Uptime
- WLAN

## Logfiles / Configuration Settings

## Features

## Todo

## Tested Hardware
 - Odroid C1
 - Raspberry Pi 1

## GPIOs
You can read and control GPIOs too.
All what you need to do is to configure in the settings the GPIOs options (additional tab).

![GPIOs](img/pi3_gpio.png)

After some ports are enabled following states appear in the object tree:
- rpi.0.gpio.PORT.state

The numeration of ports is BCM (BroadComm pins on chip). You can get the enumeration with ```gpio readall```.
For instance PI2:

## DHTxx/AM23xx Sensors
You can read from DHT11, DHT22 and AM2302 temperature/humidity sensors.

Connect such a sensor to a GPIO pin as described on the [node-dht-sensor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-dht-sensor) package page. Multiple sensors can be connected to *multiple* pins (this is *not* a bus system) as discussed.
