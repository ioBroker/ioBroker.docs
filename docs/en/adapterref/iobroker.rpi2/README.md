RPI-Monitor Adapter for ioBroker

RPI-Monitor implementation for integration into ioBroker. It is the same implementation as for iobroker.rpi, but with GPIOs.

## Important Information

**ioBroker needs special permissions to control GPIOs.** On most Linux distributions this can be achieved by adding the ioBroker user to the `gpio` group.

For gpio to work, you need to install `libgpiod` in version `2.x`, **before** installing the adapter (see below)!

## Installation

After installation you have to configure all required modules via administration page.

After start of iobroker.rpi, all selected modules generates
an object tree in ioBroker within rpi.<instance>.<modulename>
e.g. `rpi.0.cpu`

Be sure, that python and build-essential are installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential python
sudo apt install -y libgpiod-dev
```

(the last one is only necessary, if you want to work with GPIOs)

Following Objects are available after selection:

#### **CPU**

- cpu_frequency
- load1
- load5
- load15

#### **Raspberry (vcgencmd is required)**

- cpu_voltage
- mem_arm
- mem_gpu

#### **Memory**

- memory_available
- memory_free
- memory_total

#### **Network (eth0)**
- net_received
- net_send

#### **SDCard**
- sdcard_boot_total
- sdcard_boot_used
- sdcard_root_total
- sdcard_root_used

#### **Swap**
- swap_total
- swap_used

#### **Temperature**
- soc_temp

#### **Uptime**
- uptime

#### **WLAN**
- wifi_received
- wifi_send

## Configuration
On configuration page you can select following modules:

- CPU
- Raspberry
- Memory
- Network
- SDCard
- Swap
- Temperature
- Uptime
- WLAN

### NVME temperature
Since adapter version 2.3.2 you can read NVMe temperature. To do this, you need to install `nvme-cli` package on your system. 
You can do this with the following command: `sudo apt-get install nvme-cli`. You will also need to add the command to the ioBroker
sudoers file `/etc/sudoers.d/iobroker`. Open it with an editor, for example nano: `sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/iobroker` and add the following line:
`nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0` to the bottom.

## GPIOs
You can read and control GPIOs too.
All what you need to do is to configure in the settings the GPIOs options (additional tab).

![GPIOs](img/pi3_gpio.png)

After some ports are enabled following states appear in the object tree:
- rpi.0.gpio.PORT.state

The numeration of ports is BCM (BroadComm pins on chip). You can get the enumeration with ```gpio readall```.
For instance PI2:

## DHTxx/AM23xx Sensors
You can read from DHT11, DHT22 and AM2302 temperature/humidity sensors.

Connect such a sensor to a GPIO pin as described on the [node-dht-sensor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-dht-sensor) package page. Multiple sensors can be connected to *multiple* pins (this is *not* a bus system) as discussed.
