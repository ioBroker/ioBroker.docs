This adapter shows all web and admin instances of ioBroker on one page on port 80 (configurable)

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.**
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

Normally, this adapter should be running on port 80 or 443, and it shows available adapters with web servers.

Optionally, you can provide the instance, to which it will be redirected automatically by opening of the welcome page.
In this case, by opening of http://IP it will be immediately redirected to a specified web instance.
