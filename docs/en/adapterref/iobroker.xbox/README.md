## Steps 

* Fulfill the requirements
* Install the adapter and control your Xbox One or Xbox One X

## Requirements
* If you want to power your Xbox on with this adapter, you have to
[configure the instant-on power modus](https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/console/learn-about-power-modes) on your Xbox.

## Acknowledgement
Thanks to [Team Open Xbox](https://openxbox.org/) for developing and maintaining the
[xbox-rest-server](https://github.com/OpenXbox/xbox-smartglass-core-node) and the related libraries.
Without their effort, developing this package would not be possible.

## Installation
You can install the adapter via Admin interface or on your terminal.

1. Open your ioBroker web interface in a browser (eg: 192.168.30.70:8081)
2. Click on Tab "Adapters"
3. Type "Xbox" in the filter
4. Click on the three points and then on the "+" symbol of the Xbox adapter <br/>
![Add Adapter](/docs/en/img/plusAddAdapter.png)

## Setup
1. Fill in the Live ID of your Xbox in the settings of the adapter instance. You can find the Live ID in the settings of your console: System > Console info > *"Xbox Live device ID"* or *"Xbox network device ID"* (depending on which Xbox model and firmware is used)
2. Fill in the ip address of your Xbox.
3. Save the settings and open the ioBroker log.
4. To start the login procedure, open the Link from the log (*Xbox login url available at: \<link\>*) in a webbrowser. Then copy the API key, which can be found after `code=` in the url of the browser's address bar, into the "API Token" field of the adapter instance settings.

## States
In this section you can find a description of every state of the adapter.

    |boolean|R/W|

   *Boolean-value to turn your Xbox on and off. State also indicates current power status of the Xbox.*

* settings.launchTitle/launchStoreTitle

    |Data type|Permission|
    |:---:|:---:|
    |string|R/W|

   *A writable string, which allows the user to launch a specific title by its title id
   (converted to hexadecimal). To find out about the hex code of a desired title, you can
   use the info.currentTitles state. The command is acknowledged when it has arrived at the server,
   which does not mean, that the command has been executed.*

   *Example:*
    ```javascript
    setState('settings.launchTitle', '2340236c', false); // Launch Red Dead Redemption 2
    ```
  
    With `launchStoreTitle` you can use real names. The adapter will search for the title in store and take the ID of
    the first result.

    |:---:|:---:|
    |string|R/W|

   *Writable string, which allows the user to fill text into an active text field, e.g. to send
   private messages. The command is acknowledged when it has arrived at the server, which does
   not mean, that the command has been executed.*

   ```javascript
   setState('settings.inputText', 'H1 M8 h0w d0 u do?', false); // Send a super nerdy text to someone
   ```

* settings.gameDvr

    authenticate is turned on in the settings. You have to be logged in on your Xbox with the same account
    as you are authenticated with. A game needs to be in the foreground.
    
    *Example:*
   ```javascript
   setState('settings.gameDvr', '-60,30', false); // record last 60 seconds until the next 30 seconds (total of 90 seconds)
   ```
