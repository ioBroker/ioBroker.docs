The developers of this module are in no way endorsed by or affiliated with
Microsoft Corporation, or any associated subsidiaries, logos or trademarks.

## Steps 

* Fulfill the requirements
* Install the adapter and control your Xbox One or Xbox One X

## Requirements

* You need to have Python >= 3.7 installed
* For Linux additional packages are required.
   
   The required packages will automatically be installed. Due to this fact root privileges are required as well as the 
   --unsafe-perm flag. If this fails, you have to install the packages manually (`build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev 
   python3-dev`).
* If you want to power your Xbox on with this adapter, you have to
[configure the instant-on power modus](https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/console/learn-about-power-modes) on your Xbox.

## Acknowledgement
Thanks to [Team Open Xbox](https://openxbox.org/) for developing and maintaining the
[xbox-rest-server](https://github.com/OpenXbox/xbox-smartglass-rest-python) and the related libraries.
Without their effort, developing this package would not be possible.

## Installation
You can install the adapter via Admin interface or on your terminal.

### Admin
1. Open your ioBroker web interface in a browser (eg: 192.168.30.70:8081)
2. Click on Tab "Adapters"
3. Type "Xbox" in the filter
4. Click on the three points and then on the "+" symbol of the Xbox adapter <br/>
![Add Adapter](/docs/en/img/plusAddAdapter.png)

### Terminal
Navigate into your ioBroker folder and execute the following command (on Linux Root privileges are required to install 
the additional packages, use sudo):
 
```bash
npm i iobroker.xbox --unsafe-perm
```

### Setup
1. Fill in the Live ID of your Xbox in the settings of the adapter. You can find the Live ID in the settings of your console.
2. Fill in the ip address of your Xbox. <br/>
![Adapter Configuration](/docs/en/img/adapter-configuration.png)
3. If you want to use the features which require authentication on Xbox Live,
you have to enable the authenticate checkbox.
4. Provide the e-mail address as well as the password of you Xbox Live account.

   while the value is the title id converted to hexadecimal. The hex title id can be used to launch a
   title via the settings.launchTitlte state.*
