# Multicast-APi adapter for ioBroker
  
This adapter provides an API based on multicast communication protocol to send and receive states to devices with custom firmware.

Purpose of this adapter was :

* provide an alternative to http post and MQTT protokoll
* Have a uniform API available based on multicast communication and JSON formatted data transmission
* Have an zero-touch adapter in place to integrate any ethernet device (example : ESP based board eq Wemos D1 mini), like Vansware/Gosound smart plugs or other custom build automation.

### Zero touch ?

The APi is build in a way that requires no additional configuration of end-user using in the adapter itself or the device to be used.
I case wifi transmittion is used, only the wifi credential must be provided (lan based devices will be  handled fully automatically).
This requires effort by the developer of binary file to be flashed on the related chipset (like ESP based chipsets).

When the firmware follows all rules of the APi (see further below) the communication is handled as following :

* Device sends state values by UDP multicast
* Adapter recognizes this message and checks if states for this device are present in ioBroker

#### New Device
From previous message the adapter indicated no device found, following routine will be handled :

* ioBroker sends broadcast message to initialize device
* Device sends alle states and related structure to ioBroker
* ioBroker create the new device and all required states
* When all states are created, ioBroker sends an handshake to the device "ready to receive data"
* Device start sending his states in intervals or by changes ( as programmed by developer of device)

#### Existing Devices reconnection
From previous message the adapter indicated device already exist, following routine will be handled :

* ioBroker checks if configuration is set to "restore"
* When restore is activated, ioBroker sends all states (exept info states) to the device
* When all states are received, the de device sends an handshake to ioBroker "ready to receive data"
* ioBroker confirms
* Device start sending his states in intervals or by changes ( as programmed by developer of device)

#### State changes
The adapter is build to send up to 5-times a retry to ensure all state changes are received by the device. This procedure is handled as following :

* State is changed in ioBroker
* Adapter recognizes the value change and will send the new value to the device
* The device must confirm the message within 500ms
* If message is not confirmed, the adapter will resend the value again
* This will be handle up to an maximum of 5 retry's, after that a error message will indicate communication lost

### APi structure and documentation

{ to be done / in progress }


## To-Do planned :

* [ ] Implement queuing, wait 20ms after state change for device and send array with all state updates
* [ ] Implement expire value by API
* [x] Optimise state retry, dont fire every 500ms more queuing
* [x] Send recovery data if Harbeat is received and connection to device is FALSE
* [x] Implement states (capability for value list)
* [x] Correct handling of hostname and hostname changes
