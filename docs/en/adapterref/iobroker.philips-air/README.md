**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Philips air purifier adapter for ioBroker
Connects Philips air purifier with ioBroker.
**Tested only with AC2729**, but should work with new purifier that communicate via COAP with encryption.

## Usage
Only IP address of device is required. Find it in your router (e.g. `MiCO`).
It can happen, that some devices have not all variables, and they will stay unfilled in object tree.
