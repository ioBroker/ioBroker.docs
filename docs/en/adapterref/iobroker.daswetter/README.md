**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** 
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

This adapter reads weather forecast data from DasWetter.com.

You need an account on DasWetter.com. Register at https://www.daswetter.com/api/#/login
The account is for free under certain conditions.

In your account you will find three URL for four different data models:
* Forecast for the next 7 days and general information of the day: high and low, wind (symbol and description), Day symbol and weather conditions
* detailed information for 5 days and every 3 hours: The general daily information is the following: peak, lows, wind, gusts, Precipitation, relative humidity, 
sea level air pressure, snow line, Sunrise and sunset, dates related to the moon, local time
* Preview with detailed data every hour (only for the first 2 days, then every 3 hours)
* Prediction for 5 days and every 3 hours (in JSON format)

All four models are implemented and one should be used at least.
In settings URL like http://api.daswetter.com/index.php?api_lang=de&localidad=xxxx  must be used. Just copy the complete URL from your account.

## Hints
### icons used in vis
* Access icons like `http://ip:8082/adapter/daswetter/icons/tiempo-weather/galeria1/1.png`.
* in galerie6 original icons are in svg format. Vis app might have problems to visualize it. So converted png are available. Just use option "use png"
* in galerie5 original icons are in svg and png format. Beside also color and white versions are available

### "current" in NextHours_Day1:
* DasWetter.com does not deliver real current weather values
* but sometimes it's helpfull to have the forecast of current hour available
* so we added "current" which is just a copy of related forecast hour values
* please make sure you call the adapter at least one time per hour to make sure "current" is updated well
* see also github feature request [issue24](https://github.com/rg-engineering/ioBroker.daswetter/issues/24)

### path 4
* at the moment DasWetter.com sends data which are different to their own specification. 
Now we have implemented a "auto-repair" which changes to structure to documented shape.

## known issues
* please create issues at [github](https://github.com/rg-engineering/ioBroker.daswetter/issues) if you find bugs or whish new features
