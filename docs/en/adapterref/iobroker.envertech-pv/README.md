**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.**
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## ioBroker.envertech-pv

The ioBroker.envertech-pv adapter empowers you to access and gather data from the [envertech cloud service](www.envertecportal.com) easily. By regularly polling the web service, this adapter ensures that all valuable information is promptly retrieved and stored in easily accessible states.

## Credits

This adapter would not have been possible without the great work of @adcrafter27 (https://github.com/adcrafter27), who analyzed and documented the REST API used to access the envertech cloud service.

## How to report issues and feature requests

Ideally, please use GitHub issues for this, with the best method achieved by setting the adapter to Debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Then retrieve the logfile from disk via the  'log' ioBroker subdirectory, **not** from Admin, which will cut lines. If you prefer to avoid providing it in a GitHub issue, email me (mcm57@gmx.at). Please reference the relevant **GitHub issue**, provide corresponding **descriptive commentary** and add **log timestamp(s)** where appropriate.
