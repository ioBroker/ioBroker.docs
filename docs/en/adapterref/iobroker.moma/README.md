## moma adapter for ioBroker

**MoMa** is an adapter for **Mo**nitoring and **Ma**intenance of an ioBroker based home automation installation.
**MoMa** aims at home (automation) installations which are a bit more complex than a single machine running all in one or a small number of machines doing some basic load balancing within one network.

It is not intended as a replacement for administration tools like **Puppet**, **Chef**, **Salt** or **Ansible**.
Those are for large environments with many computers and are capable of remote installation of packages. **MoMa** will only be able to remotely update existing installations, no remote installation and no remote configuration.


I am using it for monitoring my IT-Infrastructure at home (including home automation) and keeping it up to date.


MoMa uses the platform independant library 'systeminformation' (https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) to gather information about the computer. Many of the calls are exposed to be used in timer intervalls - see reference below.

MoMa needs at least nodejs version 8 / ES9 / ECMAScript2018.

## Installation

Available in ioBroker repository 'latest'

alternative:

npm install iobroker.moma

Works also in multihost environments - ensure that the correct instance is selected before installation.

**Attention:** Currently you need to install an instance of Admin-Adapter on every slave as workaround. 
The Admin-Adapter does not need to be active!

## Core Concept

still under construction - ideas, proposals, hints, ... are welcome!

Forum: https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/22026/neuer-adapter-iobroker-moma

GitHub: https://github.com/AWhiteKnight/ioBroker.moma

Basic idea is to have 
+ a tree for each instance (moma.\<instance-id\>) containing all the informations of the machine the instance is running on. 
+ a common tree (moma.meta) below which every instance creates a device \<hostname\> containing a reference to the instance and some monitoring informations.
+ an admin tab for maintenance (updates of operating system, js-controller, adapters)

## Reference

An admin tabMoMa is available to start updates or if necessary start a reboot.

Following functions of library systeminformation are called once on startup:
* baseboard - Information about computers motherboard
* chassis - Information about computers chassis
* bios - Information about computers BIOS
* system - Information about computers manufacturer
* cpu - Information about computers CPU
* cpuFlags - CPU flags available
* memLayout - Information about computers memory chips
* diskLayout - Information about computers harddisks


Following functions of library systeminformation are called in interval 0 (default every second):
* time - Actual time, timezone and uptime
* cpuCurrentSpeed - Actual cpu and core frequencies
* networkConnections - Actual network connections
* currentLoad - Actual cpu load
* processes - Process overview with process.list as HTML-table


Following functions of library systeminformation are called in interval 1 (default every 10 seconds):
* mem - Information about memory usage
* cpuTemperature - Temperatures of cpu and cores
* networkStats - Network statistics
* fullLoad - Average load since last boot


Following functions of library systeminformation are called in interval 2 (default every minute):
* battery - State of charge and information about battery
* users - Current user sessions
* fsSize - Information about computers file system
* blockDevices - Connected block devices
* fsStats - File access statistics - not supported with Windows
* disksIO - IO statistics of block devices - not supported with Windows


Following functions of library systeminformation are called in interval 3 (default every hour):
* networkInterfaceDefault - Default network interface
* networkInterfaces - Avilable network interfaces
* graphics - Information about computers graphics cards and connected monitors
* inetLatency - Check internet latency against 8.8.8.8
* dockerInfo - General information on docker - needs an "adduser iobroker docker" on the machine before it will work properly
* dockerContainers - List of all docker Containers - needs an "adduser iobroker docker" on the machine before it will work properly


Following functions of library systeminformation are called in interval 4 (default every day):
* osInfo - Information about computers operating system
* uuid - UUID's of installation
* shell - Default system shell - not supported with Windows
* versions - Versions of installed software packages


Following functions of **MoMa** are called in interval 4 (default every day):
* updates - checks for pending updates and shows the amount of updates in moma.meta.\<hostname\>.updates (currently only Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, RedHat)
* checkIob - checks all adapters and the js-controller for available updates 
* checkBatteries - checks battery state variables (current implemented state names: LOWBAT, LOW_BAT)
