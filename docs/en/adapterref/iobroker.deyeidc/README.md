## deyeidc adapter for ioBroker

Data Collector vor Deye-compatible Inverter

### Getting started

This adapter makes it possible to read data from an inverter in the local network. For this, only the IP of the inverter and the serial number of the logger must be entered. If the port differs from the default value, this can also be adjusted. 60 seconds is preset as a practicable value for the sampling rate.

The data itself is retrieved via known Modbus registers and stored in the data points. This was developed and tested on a "Deye-compatible" inverter. The registers to be queried may therefore differ for other models.

## Usage

To commission the adapter, the register areas and coils must also be entered in the GUI on the following pages. In the meantime, there are already example entries for various types on github (e.g. https://github.com/raschy/ioBroker.deyeidc/blob/main/deyeidc.MI600.json).
Basically, the registers must be determined from the respective documentation. Depending on the type of content, decoding is done via the "rules".

The following applies here:
| Rules | Descriptions |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 0 | raw_signed |
| 1 | for 16-bit-unsigned Values |
| 2 | for 16-bit-signed Values |
| 3 | for 32-bit-unsigned Values |
| 4 | for 32-bit-signed Values |
| 5 | for Serial Number |
| 6 | for Temperature |
| 7 | for Version Number |
| 8 | for SingleBytes (MSB) |
| 9 | for SingleBytes (LSB) |

The documentation also shows whether the decimal point must be shifted by one or two digits. The entry "Factor" serves this purpose. Herewith no further meaningful calculations can be made.

Certain values are not supplied by the inverter and must be calculated independently. For this purpose, two values per line can be entered in the table 'compute', which are then calculated.
A typical example is "DV1 \* DC1", where the result is then stored in "Key" with the corresponding unit in the data tree. Please note that only one basic calculation type can be processed per line. Bracket rules are therefore not possible and are not supported.
