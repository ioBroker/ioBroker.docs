## artnet-recorder adapter for ioBroker

Record Art-Net data to a file for later playback

## Purpose

Simple adapter to record Art-Net data which is sent by broadcast to a json file located in user data.
Record only the change in the DMX values.
Playback sends the data as is with the timing stored in the json file.
When merge-mode is LTP or HTP the server listens to all ArtDMX packets sent through the network
and tries to have a actual DMX data image to add the stored values.
The interval or the stepping to send the data ist set by the configuartion.
