## puppeteer adapter for ioBroker

Headless browser to generate screenshots based on Chrome

## Disclaimer
Puppeteer is a product of Google Inc. The developers of this module are in no way endorsed by or affiliated with Google Inc., 
or any associated subsidiaries, logos or trademarks.

## How-To
The adapter is fully configurable via states and does not provide settings in the admin interface.
The states (besides `url`) will not get any ack-flag by the adapter and ack-flags are ignored in general.

### States

#### filename
Specify the filename (full path) of the image.

#### url
Specify the url you want to take a screenshot from. If the state is written, a screenshot will be created immediately.
After the screenshot is created, the adapter will set the ack flag of url state to true.

#### fullPage
If this state evaluates to true, it will perform a screenshot of the full page. The crop options will be ignored.

#### cropLeft/Top/Height/Width
Configure the crop options in `px` to only screenshot the desired segment of the page. 
If `fullPage` is set to true, no cropping will be performed.

#### waitForSelector
The screenshot will be taken after the selector is visible on the page e.g. `#time`. If `waitForSelector` is active, 
other wait oeprations like `renderTime` are ignored.

#### renderTime
Interval in ms to wait till the page will be rendered

### Messages
Alternatively you can take screenshots by sending messages to the adapter.
All options beside from `url` and `ioBrokerOptions` are passed directly to the Puppeteer API, the currently supported parameters can be found
below, for a more up-to-date version check the [API description](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.screenshotoptions). 
Additionally, you can define a `waitOption` to wait for a given time or for a selector. Finally, you can use the `ioBrokerOptions.storagePath` 
option to save screenshots directly to the ioBroker storage under `0_userdata.0` which can then be viewed via admin and visualization adapters.

```typescript
sendTo('puppeteer.0', 'screenshot', { url: 'https://www.google.com',
      ioBrokerOptions?: {
        /**
         * Define a filename for the ioBroker storage e.g. test.png
         */
        storagePath: string;
      },
      /**
       * Define at most one wait option
       * You can also look for other waitOptions currently supported by Puppeteer API
       * see e.g. https://puppeteer.github.io/puppeteer/docs/puppeteer.page.waitforfilechooser
       */
      waitOption?: {
        /**
         * Define a Timeout in ms
         */
        waitForTimeout?: 5000,
    
        /**
         * Wait for a given id/tag/etc to be occured
         */
        waitForSelector?: '#testId'
      },
      /**
       * Optionally, specify the viewport manually, see https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.viewport
       */
      viewportOptions?: {
        width: 800,
        height: 600
      },
      /**
       * The file path to save the image to. The screenshot type will be inferred
       * from file extension. If path is a relative path, then it is resolved
       * relative to current working directory. If no path is provided, the image
       * won't be saved to the disk.
       */
      path?: string,
      /**
       * When true, takes a screenshot of the full page.
       * @defaultValue false
       */
      fullPage?: boolean,
      /**
       * An object which specifies the clipping region of the page.
       */
      clip?: {         
        x: number,
        y: number,
        width: number,
        height: number 
      };
      /**
       * Quality of the image, between 0-100. Not applicable to `png` images.
       */
      quality?: number,
      /**
       * Hides default white background and allows capturing screenshots with transparency.
       * @defaultValue false
       */
      omitBackground?: boolean,
      /**
       * Encoding of the image.
       * @defaultValue 'binary'
       */
      encoding?: 'base64' | 'binary',
      /**
       * If you need a screenshot bigger than the Viewport
       * @defaultValue true
       */
      captureBeyondViewport?: boolean,
  }, obj => {
      if (obj.error) {
        log(`Error taking screenshot: ${obj.error.message}`, 'error');
      } else {
        // the binary representation of the image is contained in `obj.result`
        log(`Successfully took screenshot: ${obj.result}`);
      }
});
```
