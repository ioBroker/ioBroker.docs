## Coronavirus Live Statistics adapter for ioBroker

Adapter to show Global Coronavirus information and current reports

There is no configuration required, after installation it will : 

- Receive global information world-wide and write it to "global_totals"
- Create a folder for each country with all relevant information regarding COVID-19
- Update the information every 15 minutes

The following information is available : 

| Datapoint | Details |
|--|--|
| active | Amount of current infected people |
| cases | Amount of totally known cases |
| casesPerOneMillion | Amount of totally known cases per million citizen |
| critical | Amount of critical situation (Hospitalized) |
| deaths | Amount of current registered deaths |
| deathsPerOneMillion | Amount of current registered deaths per million citizen |
| flag | Country flag, link to github location |
| recovered | Amount of totally known recovered cases |
| todayCases | New Cases by Today |
| todayDeaths | Amount of totally known people died today |
| test | Total number of COVID-19 tests taken globally |
| tests per one  million counties | Total number of COVID-19 tests taken globally per one  million |

Please be aware this adapter uses as much as possible up-to-date information but there can be a delay of several hours depending on the country's report.  
German Federal States : https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/  s

## Advanced settings
| Option | Description |
|--|--|
| All Countries | Get data for all countries World-Wide (Default: false) |
| Continents | Group total amounts by a continent in separate state (Default: false) |
| Delete unused States | Delete data when countries are deselected (Default: false) |

## For Germany only
| Option | Description |
|--|--|
| Federal states| Get federal state data for Germany (Selected only, Default false) |
| counties | Get data for Germany counties (Selected only, Default false) |
| Cities | Get data for Germany cities (Selected only, Default false) |
| All federal states | All Germany federal states  (Default false) |
| All cities | All Germany cities (Default false) |
| All counties | All Germany counties (Default false) |

It's possible to get data for federal states (Bundesländer), cities (Städte) counties (Landeskreise).
You can choose to receive all data or just select specific regions in advanced settings.

<span style="color:red">Vaccination data is currently only available for Germany and will only be retrieved when *"Bundesländer"* is activated</span>

## Add missing countries
It may happen that countries are not recognized correctly because the API delivers some country names not ISO conform. In such a case you will get a warning message in the log, which looks like this

```
coronavirus-statistics.0	2020-03-21 09:05:31.328	warn	(22937) Timor-Leste not found in lib! Must be added to the country name translator.
```

Using the datapoint `coronavirus-statistics.0.countryTranslator` you can assign a country yourself. Look for the name of the corresponding country here:

[List with country names](https://github.com/i-rocky/country-list-js/blob/master/data/names.json)

With the selected country name you have to create a JSON string and enter it in the datapoint `coronavirus-statistics.0.countryTranslator`.
The JSON string then looks like this, for example:

```
{
	"Cabo_Verde": "Cape Verde",
	"Timor-Leste": "East Timor"
}
```

As first value, the name from the warning message must be taken from the log. The name of the country from the [List with country names](https://github.com/i-rocky/country-list-js/blob/master/data/names.json) is then assigned to this.
