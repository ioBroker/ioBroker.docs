## Coronavirus Live Statistics adapter for ioBroker

Adapter to show Global Coronavirus information and current reports

There is no configuration required, after installation it will : 

- Receive global information world-wide and write it to "global_totals"
- Create a folder for each country with all relevant information regarding COVID-19
- Update the information every 15 minutes

The following information is available : 

| Datapoint | Details |
|--|--|
| active | Amount of current infected people |
| cases | Amount of totally known cases |
| casesPerOneMillion | Amount of totally known cases per million citizen |
| critical | Amount of critical situation (Hospitalized) |
| deaths | Amount of current registered deaths |
| deathsPerOneMillion | Amount of current registered deaths per million citizen |
| flag | Country flag, link to github location |
| recovered | Amount of totally known recovered cases |

| todayDeaths | Amount of totally known people died today |
| test | Total number of COVID-19 tests taken globally |
| tests per one  million counties | Total number of COVID-19 tests taken globally per one  million |

Please be aware this adapter uses as much as possible up-to-date information, but there can be a delay of several hours depending on the country's report.
