The protocol Contact ID used by alarm systems to communicate with central stations.

This adapter is a Contact ID Server. When an alarm event is triggered, the alarm system sends over IP the Contact ID message to the central station.
You can use ioBroker with this adapter as central station. For example. you can send for a alarm by Conntact ID a telegram message.

The Contact-ID message

SSSS 18QEEEGGZZZC

- SSSS – Subscriber. These four digits identify the specific alarm system or customer to the central station. ioBroker allows longer subscriber names.

- 18 - Message Type. Basically this field should always be “18”.
- Q – Event Qualifier.
- EEE – Event Code.
- GG – Group/Partition Number.
- ZZZ – Zone Number (001 - 999). This is the number of the zone that triggered the alarm.
- C – Checksum.
