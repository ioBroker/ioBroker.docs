## IP-Cameras adapter for ioBroker
You can integrate you web/ip cameras into vis and other visualisations.
If you configure a camera with name `cam1` it will be available on 
web server under `http(s)://iobroker-IP:8082/cameras.0/cam1`.

Additionally, you the image could be requested via message:
```
sendTo('cameras.0', 'image', {
    name: 'cam1', 
    width: 100, // optional 
    height: 50, // optional
    angle: 90   // optional
}, result => {
    const img = 'data:' + result.contentType + ';base64,' + result.data;
    console.log('Show image: ' + img);    
}); 
```

The result is always in `jpg` format.

Supported cameras:
### URL image
This is normal URL request, where all parameters are in URL. Like `http://mycam/snapshot.jpg`  

### URL image with basic authentication
This is URL request for image, where all parameters are in URL, but you can provide the credentials for basic authentication. Like `http://mycam/snapshot.jpg`
