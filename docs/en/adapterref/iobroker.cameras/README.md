## IP-Cameras adapter for ioBroker
You can integrate your web/ip cameras into vis and other visualizations.
If you configure a camera with name `cam1` it will be available on 
web server under `http(s)://iobroker-IP:8082/cameras.0/cam1`.

Additionally, the image could be requested via a message:
```js
sendTo('cameras.0', 'image', {
    name: 'cam1', 
    width: 100, // optional 
    height: 50, // optional
    angle: 90,   // optional
    noCache: true // optional, if you want to get the image not from cache
}, result => {
    const img = 'data:' + result.contentType + ';base64,' + result.data;
    console.log('Show image: ' + img);    
}); 
```

The result is always in `jpg` format.

Supported cameras:
- `Reolink E1 Pro` via RTSP (important, without `Pro` it will not work)
- `Eufy` via eusec adapter
- [HiKam](https://support.hikam.de/support/solutions/articles/16000070656-zugriff-auf-kameras-der-2-generation-via-onvif-f%C3%BCr-s6-q8-a7-2-generation-) of second and third generation via ONVIF (f√ºr S6, Q8, A7 2. Generation), A7 Pro, A9
- [WIWICam M1 via HiKam adapter](https://www.wiwacam.com/de/mw1-minikamera-kurzanleitung-und-faq/)
- RTSP Native - if your camera supports RTSP protocol
- Screenshots via HTTP URL - if you can get the snapshot from your camera via URL

### URL image
This is a normal URL request, where all parameters are in URL. Like `http://mycam/snapshot.jpg`  

### URL image with basic authentication
This is URL request for image, where all parameters are in URL, but you can provide the credentials for basic authentication. Like `http://mycam/snapshot.jpg`  

### FFmpeg
If you want to access snapshots on RTSP cameras, you can use ffmpeg. You need to install ffmpeg on your system:
- Windows has precompiled ffmpeg and there is no need to download anything. (Windows version is taken from here: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z)
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg -y`

How to update the windows version of `ffmpeg`:
- Download file https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z
- Extract `bin/ffmpeg.exe`
- Rename `ffmpeg.exe` to `win-ffmpeg.exe`
- Zip `win-ffmpeg.exe` to `win-ffmpeg.zip`
- Place `win-ffmpeg.zip` in the root of this repository
- Execute `win-ffmpeg.exe --version` to get the version and save it into `main.ts` `WIN_FFMPEG_VERSION` constant (like `2025-02-02-git-957eb2323a-full_build-www.gyan.dev`)

Here is an example of how to add Reolink E1:

### Ezviz - How to re-enable RTSP for EZVIZ cameras
For some reason, EZVIZ decided to disable RTSP for their cameras:
- Open EZVIZ App and go to: Profile / Settings / Lan Live View
- Start scanning and then Select Camera:
- Login with your camera password (the default password is on the camera sticker)
- Press the Settings icon and select Local Service Settings
- Enable RTSP

## How to add a new camera (For developers)
To add a new camera, you must create a Pull Request on GitHub with the following changes:
- Add a new file into `cameras` folder. This is a backend to read the single image from the camera. 
- Add a GUI file in the `src/src/Types/` folder. This is the configuration dialog for the camera
- Add this dialog in `src/src/Tabs/Cameras.js` file analogical as other cameras are added. Only two lines should be added:
  - Import new configuration dialog like `import RTSPMyCamConfig from '../Types/RTSPMyCam';`
  - Extend `TYPES` structure with the new camera like `mycam: { Config: RTSPMyCamConfig, name: 'MyCam' },`
    The attribute name must be the same as the name of the file in the `cameras` folder.

## Todo
- [ ] Send new subscribe requests for RTSP cameras if the dialog is opened or closed
