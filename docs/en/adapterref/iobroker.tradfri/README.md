## Requirements
* Linux (e.g. Raspberry Pi) / OSX / Windows
* NodeJS >= 12.x
* Tr√•dfri gateway

## Installation
1. Install this adapter over the iobroker admin GUI or via `npm install iobroker.tradfri --production` 
1. In the ioBroker GUI, add an adapter instance. 
1. Configure the instance by entering the IP/hostname of your gateway and the security code that can be found on the label at the bottom.

### Troubleshooting installation issues:
#### Linux/OSX:
Make sure you install the most recent released version. If there are compilation errors, you might have to install build-essential:
```
apt-get -y install build-essential
```

#### Windows:
If you are running on older NodeJS versions (< 10), the installation may fail with the following error somewhere in the log:
```
Can't find Python executable "python", you can set the PYTHON env variable.
```

To solve it, open an administrative shell:
1. Press the <kbd>&#8862;&nbsp;Windows</kbd> key
2. Enter `cmd`, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>
3. Confirm the UAC prompt
and run the following command:
```
npm install --add-python-to-path --global windows-build-tools
```
This may take a while... afterwards the installation should succeed.

## Sending custom CoAP packets
You can send custom CoAP packets from other adapters by using `sendTo`. Example from JavaScript:
```js
sendTo("tradfri.0", "request", options, (ret) => {
	// do something with the result
});
```
The `options` object looks as follows:
```js
{
	path: string,
	method?: "get" | "post" | "put" | "delete", // optional, default = "get"
	payload?: object                            // optional, should be a JSON object
}
```
The result object `ret` looks as follows:
```js
{
	error: string | null,
	result: {
		code: string,            // see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252#section-12.1.2
		payload: object | Buffer
	}
}
```
