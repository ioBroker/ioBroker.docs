## About <a id="about"/>

This ioBroker Adapter is used in connection with our [air-Q device](https://www.air-q.com). It polls the values from our sensors and displays them for you in the ioBroker environment.

## Getting started <a id="start" />

You should be able to find the adapter through the admin interface.

Otherwise you're welcome to use the ioBroker command line interface through the console. Simply direct to your ioBroker root folder and add the adapter via
```
iobroker add air-q
```
This installs the adapter (if it isn't installed already) and starts an instance. 
In case you only want to install the adapter without creating an instance yet, use the following command:

```
iobroker install air-q
```

For more information visit the ioBroker CLI documentation under https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker/wiki/Console-commands. 

To configure your instance you simply select whether you want to connect it through the IP or the short-ID of your device.

Please make sure you enter the correct IP/ID and password. 
Then you can also choose how the data should be retrieved. You can clip negative values if you don't need them, with the exception of temperature, of course. You can set up how often the data should be polled by typing in the number in seconds. And lastly you can choose between realtime data or average data.

Now you should be all set up and good to go!

The data will be retrieved and shown in the objects-tab according to your configuration, when the device is found. Of course, depending on the device you own, there might be more sensors shown.

***For now we have all sensors for the air-Q Pro included. Optional sensors will be included in a future patch.***
