## Sentry
**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.**
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## PID Adapter for ioBroker

This adapter provides a configurable PID Controller.

## General Information

This adapter provides the functionality of a PID controller.

In practical terms, a PID controller automatically calculates a correction value for a system based on an actual value and a setpoint. The behavior is controller by parameters. An everyday example is the cruise control on a car, where ascending a hill would lower speed if constant engine power were applied. The controller's PID algorithm restores the measured speed to the desired speed with minimal delay and overshoot by increasing the power output of the engine in a controlled manner. [(c) Wikipedia]

Within one adapter instance there could be more than one controller configured. The adpter supports configuring the paramaters (P, I, D components) and the cycle time used for calculation. In addition caclulation can be suspended and resumed and the controlelr can be reset at all. As convinient server a manual mode can be switches on to directly set the output. Output can be limited to a minimum/maximum value and contain a fixes offset.

All relevant values including internal data are availbale as states for diagnose purposes.

## Credits

Providing this adapter would not have been possible without the great work of @Philmod (https://github.com/Philmod) who developed node-pid-controller (https://github.com/Philmod/node-pid-controller).

## How to report issues and feature requests

Please use GitHub issues for this.

Best is to set the adapter to Debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Then please get the logfile from disk (subdirectory "log" in ioBroker installation directory and not from Admin because Admin cuts the lines). If you do not like providing it in GitHub issue you can also send it to me via email (mcm57@gmx.at). Please add a reference to the relevant GitHub issue AND also describe what I see in the log at which time.
