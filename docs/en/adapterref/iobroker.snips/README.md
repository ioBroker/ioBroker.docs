ATTENTION:
The adapter is no longer being developed or maintained because Sonos bought Snips and the free platform was be discontinued on 02/01/2020. The adapter and installed snips devices will still work.

Requires node.js 6.0 or higher and Admin v3!

The adapter communicates with Snips hardware by MQTT.The text2command adapter is required to execute
the commands.
