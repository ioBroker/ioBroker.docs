## solarmanpv adapter for ioBroker

Reading data from balcony power plant


### Getting started

This adapter is used to display data of a balcony power plant, which 
is provided by a inverter "Bosswerk MI600" in ioBroker. This inverter 
is compatible with others in the Deye family.

I assume that the plant is monitored by the app "Solarman" so far. 
This adapter gets the data from this cloud.

First you have to ask Solarman support <service@solarmanpv.com> for 
the needed Credentials (app_id & app_secret) must be requested.
There may still be a query of the type, "I need to ask what platform 
are you using? What is your role? Are you an individual, O&M provider, 
manufacturer, or distributor? Can you give me your email address for 
the API?". In my case, another query then came: "Why are you applying 
for API?". I politely answered this question as well and was sent the 
necessary data the next day.

On the admin page the 4 fields  have to be according to the description. 
This adapter is created as a "scheduled" adapter. 
Since the data in the cloud is updated only about every 6 minutes, 
it does not make to start the adapter more frequently.

Since version 0.3.0, in contrast to the previous versions, a blacklist 
is made possible. This means that "all" values supplied by the Api are 
read in and the user can filter out the values that are not needed via 
the blacklist. The corresponding data points can be deleted, which 
makes the number of objects clearer.

Since 16.04.2023 Solarman has switched to a new platform. Further 
adaptations of the api, as far as they exist, have not been made.
