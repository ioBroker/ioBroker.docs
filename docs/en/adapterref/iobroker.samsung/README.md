**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

**Important note for windows users: This adapter requires git to be installed systemwide**

#### Description

Adapter for Samsung TVs

### Initial Creation
This adapter was initialy created by @soef at https://github.com/soef/ioBroker.samsung but not maintained any more, so we moved it to iobroker-community so that bugs could be fixed. thanks @soef for his work.
Adapter was extended by jogibear9988 and mwp007 with further Api since then.

#### Configuration
Enter the IP of your Samsung TV.
Choose your API:
	Samsung Remote - TVs before 2014
		After installation, you have to confirm the new connection on your TV
	Samsung HJ - 2014 and 2015
		After first connect you need to enter the Pin shown on your TV.
	Samsung2016 - selfexplaining 
	SamsungTV - Tizen TVs after 2016 



#### Requirements
Samsung TV<br>
HJ Series tested by me on UE55HU7200. 
Support for devices since 2016  experimental
if something does not work, look  in the log.
