This adapter saves state history into InfluxDB.

**The Adapter supports InfluxDB 1.x and 2.x**

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## InfluxDB version support

### InfluxDB 1.x
If you have an InfluxDB 1.x installation (preferably 1.8.x or 1.9.x) then you choose " 1.x" in the adapter configuration and enter the Host-IP and Port together with Username and Password for the Access.
You can also define a database name. The default is "iobroker". On first adapter start this database is created.

When doing custom queries via the "query" message you can use InfluxQL to select the data you want.

### InfluxDB 2.x
Since 2.0 of the adapter also InfluxDB 2.x is supported which works a bit different.
Here beside the Host-IP and Port the following data are required:
* **Organization**: You need to create an organization on the commandline and need to enter the name or ID of that organization here. If you created one Organization when doing the InfluxDB setup you have created an initial organization and can use this here, else use `influx org list` to see available organizations.
* **Authentication Token**: You need to create an Authentication token  that have sufficient rights to basically do all actions on the provided organization! **Important: For now just use the initial owner auth token because we still struggle on how to create a token that has sufficient permissions. The Owner Token was generated on InfluxDB setup process. If you know how to create the right tokens let us now :-)**

You can also define a database name - this is used as Bucket. The default is "iobroker". On first adapter start this bucket is created in the configured organization.

When doing custom queries via the "query" message you can use Flux queries to select the data you want. Details on Flux can be found at https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/reference/flux/

#### Store metadata information as tags instead of fields
For Influx 1.x state value, as well as associated metadata fields (`q`, `ack` and `from`) are stored as fields within InfluxDB. When using Flux-commands to retrieve this data (instead of InfluxQL) the data is returned in separate tables, which makes it more difficult to view the data in a joined way when using external database clients or Influx CLI `query` command. This is by design, as Influx only supports one field per data-point.

With Influx 2.x it is now also possible, to store this metadata-information besides the actual value of the state as Influx Tags. Tags are indexed and allow for faster search queries. In addition they are closely linked to the measurement stored within the db, meaning they will be returned in one table with the queried measurement which makes them much easier to handle, when used outside of this adapter. There are limitations with this however:
- The use of tags for metadata needs to be enabled under `Advanced Settings`. It is disabled by default.
- If you decide to use tags, you cannot continue to use old measurements that were gathered with Influx 1.x, as they are stored in fields.
- Attempting to use an existing database that was setup without enabling the Tag-feature will cause the adapter to fail to initialize and you will see an error message about it in the log.
  - This also is valid the other way: Once you start using the Tag-feature in a new database, you cannot switch back to using fields for this database.
- This feature is currently only available, if you use Influx 2.x. And only if you use the new responsive GUI of Admin 5.

### Migration from InfluxDB 1 to 2

Please refer to the [official guides on how to migrate](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/upgrade/v1-to-v2/) from InfluxDB 1.x to 2.x. Especially the [migration instructions for time series data](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/upgrade/v1-to-v2/manual-upgrade/#migrate-time-series-data) have been verified to work during adapter testing. Please always create a backup of your data before performing the migration.

After the migration, the adapter is able to work with the old data (e.g. for history-queries) as well. This only applies, if you don't decide to [use Tags for storing metadata fields](#Store-metadata-information-as-tags-instead-of-fields).

## Retention Policy
While Influx 1.x supports the concept of multiple **retention policies** for one database, Influx 2 by design allows only one **retention period** per bucket. Therefore, it is only possible to set one policy for the whole database/bucket with this adapter via _Default Settings -> Storage retention_. The retention selected here will be applied on the fly and can be changed at any time. Retention policies set by the adapter will never be deleted, but instead altered if required, as otherwise Influx 1.x would delete all data that the policy applied to.

Please also read [Understanding Retention Policies](RetentionPolicies.md). 

## Direct writes or buffered writes?
With the default configuration the adapter stores each single datapoint directly into the database and only use the internal buffer if the database is not available. If the database was not available the buffer is flushed at the given interval, so it can take the defined interval till the missing points are written!

By changing the configuration it is possible to cache new datapoints up to a defined count or a defined maximum interval after which all points are stored into the database. This also gives better performance and less system load compared to writing the datapoints directly.
InfluxDB has a limitation of the maximum size for writes which is at around 2MB. It should be save to have up to 15.000 datapoints as buffer maximum, maybe also 20.000, but this highly depends on the length of your datapoint-IDs.

On exit of the adapter the buffer is storedon disk and reinitialized with next adapter start, so no datapoints should be lost and will be written after next start.

## InfluxDB and datatypes
InfluxDB is very strict on datatypes. The datatype for a measurement value is defined with it's first write.
The adapter tries to write with the correct value, but if the datatype changes for the same state then there may be write
errors into the InfluxDB. The adapter detects this and will write these potential conflicting datapoints always directly, but write errors mean that the value is not written into the DB at all. So make sure to check the logs for such cases.

Additionally InfluxDB do not support "null" values, so these are not written at all into the DB.

## Installation of InfluxDB
Please refer to the official InfluxDB pages for installationinstructions depending on your OS.

* InfluxDB 1.x: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/introduction/install/
* InfluxDB 2.x: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/install/

### Setup authentication for InfluxDB 1.x (optional)
**NOTE:** Influx DB V2.x relies on organization/token login, instead of username/password! This is only applicable for InfluxDB 1.x

If you use DB localy you may leave authentication disabled and skip this part.

- Start service: ``` service influxdb start ```
- Go to admin page: http://<ip>:8083
- Create users:
```
CREATE USER "admin" WITH PASSWORD '<adminpassword>' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
CREATE USER "user" WITH PASSWORD '<userpassword>'
CREATE DATABASE "iobroker"
GRANT ALL ON "iobroker" TO "user"
```
Enable authentication, by editing /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf:
```
 [http]  
 enabled = true  
 bind-address = ":8086"  
 auth-enabled = true # âœ¨
 log-enabled = true  
 write-tracing = false  
 pprof-enabled = false  
 https-enabled = false  
 https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"  
```
- Restart service: ``` service influxdb restart ```

## Installation of Grafana (Charting Tool)
There is additional charting tool for InfluxDB - Grafana.
It must be installed additionally.

Install a current version of Grafana 3.x+ because InfluxDB support is enhanced there in comparism to earlier Grafana versions.

Under debian you can install it as described at http://docs.grafana.org/installation/debian/ .
For ARM platforms your can check vor v3.x at https://github.com/fg2it/grafana-on-raspberry.

Explanation for other OS can be found [here](http://docs.grafana.org/installation/).

After the Grafana is installed, follow [this](http://docs.grafana.org/datasources/influxdb/) to create connection.

## Custom queries
The user can execute custom queries on data from javascript adapter.

The multi-query feature is also supported. You can send multiple queries separated by a semicolon.

That's why the result is always an array with one numbered index for each query.

### Influx 1.x
Example with one query:

```
sendTo('influxdb.0', 'query', 'SELECT * FROM iobroker.global."system.adapter.admin.0.memRss" LIMIT 100', function (result) {
    if (result.error) {
        console.error(result.error);
    } else {
        // show result
         console.log('Rows: ' + JSON.stringify(result.result[0]));
    }
});
```
Two queries:

```
sendTo('influxdb.0', 'query', 'SELECT * FROM iobroker.global."system.adapter.admin.0.memRss" LIMIT 100; SELECT * FROM iobroker.global."system.adapter.admin.0.memHeapUsed" LIMIT 100', function (result) {
    if (result.error) {
        console.error(result.error);
    } else {
        // show result
        console.log('Rows First: ' + JSON.stringify(result.result[0]));
        console.log('Rows Second: ' + JSON.stringify(result.result[1]));
    }
});
```
**NOTE:** The values are coming back in the result array in filename "value" (instead of "val" as normal in ioBroker)

### Influx 2.x
In InfluxDB v2.0 onwards the SQL-based query language *InfluxQL* is deprecated in favour of *Flux*. For more information please refer to [the offical InfluxDB 2.0 documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/reference/flux/).

Example with one query:

```
sendTo('influxdb.0', 'query', 'from(bucket: "iobroker") |> range(start: -3h)', function (result) {
    if (result.error) {
        console.error(result.error);
    } else {
        // show result
         console.log('Rows: ' + JSON.stringify(result));
    }
});
```
Two queries:
**NOTE:** By default you cannot execute 2 queries at once via Flux-language, as there is no delimiter available. This adapter emulates this behaviour by defining ; as delimiter, so you can still run two queries in one statement.

```
sendTo('influxdb.0', 'query', 'from(bucket: "iobroker") |> range(start: -3h); from(bucket: "iobroker") |> range(start: -1h)" LIMIT 100', function (result) {
    if (result.error) {
        console.error(result.error);
    } else {
        // show result
        console.log('Rows First: ' + JSON.stringify(result.result[0])); //Values from last 3 hours
        console.log('Rows Second: ' + JSON.stringify(result.result[1])); //Values from last hour
    }
});
```
**NOTE:** The values are coming back in the result array in filename "value" (instead of "val" as normal in ioBroker)

## Get history
Additional to custom queries, you can use build in system function **getHistory** to access the stored history for datapoints:
```
var end = new Date().getTime();
sendTo('influxdb.0', 'getHistory', {
    id: 'system.adapter.admin.0.memRss',
    options: {
        start:      end - 3600000,
        end:        end,
        aggregate: 'average' // or 'none' to get raw values
    }
}, function (result) {
    for (var i = 0; i < result.result.length; i++) {
        console.log(result.result[i].val + ' ' + new Date(result.result[i].ts).toISOString());
    }
});
```
Possible options:
- **start** - (optional) time in ms - *new Date().getTime()*'
- **end** - (optional) time in ms - *new Date().getTime()*', by default is (now + 5000 seconds)
- **step** - (required if aggregate is not "none") used for  aggregate functions (max, min, average, total, count) step in ms of intervals
- **count** - (optional) number of values if aggregate is 'onchange'/'none' or number of intervals if other aggregate method. Count will be ignored if step is set.
- **limit** - do not return more entries than limit (only used if aggregate is 'onchange'/'none')
- **addId** - if *id* field should be included in answer
- **aggregate** - aggregate method:
    - *max* - Splice the whole time range in small intervals and find for every interval max value and use it for this interval (nulls will be ignored).
    - *min* - Same as max, but take minimal value.
    - *average* - Same as max, but take average value.
    - *total* - Same as max, but calculate total value.
    - *count* - Same as max, but calculate number of values (nulls will be calculated).
    - *none*/*onchange* - No aggregation at all. Only raw values in given period.

When raw data are selected without using 'step' the returned fields are ts, val, ack, q and from.
As soon as step is used the returned fields are ts and val.

Please hold in mind that InfluxDB aggregates on "rounded time boundaries" (see https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.11/troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues/#understanding-the-time-intervals-returned-from-group-by-time-queries)

InfluxDB is very strict when it comes to datatypes. This has effects for aggregator functions, e.g.:
* average (MEAN) can not be used for boolean values (true/false), only MIN or MAX works here
* average (MEAN) can not be used for string values (text), no aggregator makes sense here at all
* ...

## storeState
If you want to write other data into the InfluxDB you can use the build in system function **storeState**.
This function can also be used to convert data from other History adapters like History or SQL.

The given ids are not checked against the ioBroker database and do not need to be set up there, but can only be accessed directly.

The Message can have one of the following three formats:
* one ID and one state object
* one ID and array of state objects
* array of multiple IDs with state objects

## History Logging Management via Javascript
The adapter supports enabling and disabling of history logging via JavaScript and also retrieving the list of enabled datapoints with their settings.

### enable
The message requires to have the "id" of the datapoint.Additionally optional "options" to define the datapoint specific settings:

```
sendTo('influxdb.0', 'enableHistory', {
    id: 'system.adapter.influxdb.0.memRss',
    options: {
        changesOnly:  true,
        debounce:     0,
        retention:    31536000,
        maxLength:    3,
        changesMinDelta: 0.5,
        aliasId: ''
    }
}, function (result) {
    if (result.error) {
        console.log(result.error);
    }
    if (result.success) {
        //successfull enabled
    }
});
```

### disable
The message requires to have the "id" of the datapoint.

```
sendTo('influxdb.0', 'disableHistory', {
    id: 'system.adapter.influxdb.0.memRss',
}, function (result) {
    if (result.error) {
        console.log(result.error);
    }
    if (result.success) {
        //successfull enabled
    }
});
```

### get List
The message has no parameters.

```
sendTo('influxdb.0', 'getEnabledDPs', {}, function (result) {
    //result is object like:
    {
        "system.adapter.influxdb.0.memRss": {
            "changesOnly":true,
            "debounce":0,
            "retention":31536000,
            "maxLength":3,
            "changesMinDelta":0.5,
            "enabled":true,
            "changesRelogInterval":0,
            "aliasId":""
        }
        ...
    }
});
```
