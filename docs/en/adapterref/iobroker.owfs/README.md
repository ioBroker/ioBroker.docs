## *One wire file system* adapter for ioBroker.

Supported

This adapter uses the owfs library from https://www.npmjs.com/package/owjs and accordingly requires owfs server.

## Install OWFS Linux

```sudo apt-get install owfs```

Sometimes you need write following steps:
- To start the the server to communicate over serial interface with 1wire sensors 

```
owserver -d "/dev/ttyUSB0" --nozero
```

*/dev/ttyUSB0* is the name of your serial device. Here was USB stick used for that.

This command starts the 1wire server on local port 4304.

- To show the data from the local 1wire server in the file system call follwing command: 

```
owfs -C -m /mnt/1wire --allow_other
```
Before you must create the directroy */mnt/1wire* with command `mkdir /mnt/1wire`
