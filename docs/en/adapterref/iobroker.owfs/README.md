**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## *One wire file system* adapter for ioBroker.

Supported

This adapter uses the owfs library from https://www.npmjs.com/package/owjs and accordingly requires owfs server.

## Install OWFS Linux

`sudo apt-get install owfs`

Sometimes you need to write the following steps:
- To start the server to communicate over serial interface with 1wire sensors 

`owserver -d "/dev/ttyUSB0" --nozero`

`/dev/ttyUSB0` is the name of your serial device. Here was a USB stick used for that.

This command starts the 1wire server on local port 4304.

- To show the data from the local 1wire server in the file system, call the following command: 

`owfs -C -m /mnt/1wire --allow_other`

Before you must create the directory */mnt/1wire* with command `mkdir /mnt/1wire`

## Install OWFS windows
