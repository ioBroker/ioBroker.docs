## ph803w adapter for ioBroker

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

Query PH and Redox values from PH803-W devices in your network.

## Configuration
The adapter do not need any configuration. It will automatically discover PH803W devices via UDP packages in your network. This means that the ioBroekr server and the device needs to be in the same network.
Discovery is done on adapter start which means that to discover new devices added while adapter is running might need an adapter restart.

## Todo
* enhance testing: state checks and setState's
* if needed allow to specify the local network interface to listen for UDP packages
* if needed allow adding own devices by IP if discovery is not working
* if needed add a state to send out another discovery package during run of the adapter to allow discovery of new devices without adapter restart

## How to report issues and feature requests

Please use GitHub issues for this.

Best is to set the adapter to Debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Then please get the logfile from disk (subdirectory "log" in ioBroker installation directory and not from Admin because Admin cuts the lines). If you do not like providing it in GitHub issue you can also send it to me via email (iobroker@fischer-ka.de). Please add a reference to the relevant GitHub issue AND also describe what I see in the log at which time.
