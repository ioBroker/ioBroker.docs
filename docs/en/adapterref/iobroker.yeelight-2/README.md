**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

[Deutsche Beschreibung hier](README_de.md)

This adapter controls your Yeelight devices over your local network.

## Installation

For all the Yeelights you want to control, you need to enable "LAN Control" in the yeelight app settings.

## Config

You can add devices manually or find devices on the network. The default port is 55443. If you want, you can change the name, IP, port and smartname.

### smartname

If you enter a smartname, the device will be added to the iobroker.cloud and can be controlled by Alexa.

### Find device

With this button you can scan your network for devices, if something is found, the devices will be added to the table. It takes about 20 seconds to scan the network. if the devices are not found, "LAN Control" is not enabled or the devices are in a different network.

### Device not in the list

If your device is not in the list, e.g. YLTD003, use another lamp with the same features in this case (desklamp or Color or something else).

## set_scene

Usage: This method is used to set the Smart LED directly to a specified state. If the device is off, it is first turned on and then the specified command is applied.

Parameters: 3 ~ 4.

"class" can be "color", "hsv", "ct", "cf", "auto_dealy_off".

-   "color" means to change the smart LED to the specified color and brightness.
-   "hsv" means to change the Smart LED to specified color and brightness.
-   "ct" means to change the Smart LED to specified ct and brightness.
-   "cf" means start a color flow in specified way.
-   "auto_delay_off" means to turn on the Smart LED to specified brightness and start a sleep timer to turn off the light after the specified minutes.

"val1", "val2", "val3" are class-specific.

Request Example:

-   `["color", 65280, 70]`
-   `["hsv", 300, 70, 100]`
-   `["ct", 5400, 100]`
-   `["cf",0,0,"500,1,255,100,1000,1,16776960,70"]`
-   `["auto_delay_off", 50, 5]`

NOTE: Accepted in both "on" and "off" states.

For the above examples:

-   The first is to set color to "652280" and brightness to 70%.
-   The second is to set color to hue:300, saturation:70 and max brightness.
-   The third is to set CT to 5400K and 100% brightness.
-   The fourth is to start an infinite color flow on two flow tuples.
-   The fifth is to turn on the light to 50% brightness and then turn it off after 5 minutes.
