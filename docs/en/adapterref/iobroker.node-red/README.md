# ioBroker.node-red

**Note:** If you cannot find your state in the select ID dialog of the ioBroker nodes, press the update button in instance settings or restart the node-red instance. By restarting the new object list will be created.

## Settings

![General settings](./img/instance-settings-general.png)

### Maximum RAM Setting

In the adapter/instance configuration you can adjust the maximum RAM/Heap for the node-red process. The default is sufficient for smaller node-red installations. If you have many nodes or you experience performance issues or crashes of the node.red process in the logs, please upgrade the maximum RAM setting! Depending on your available RAM (see e.g. using `free -m` on "avail") increase it to 1024 (=1GB) or even higher.

### Safe Mode

Flows will not be started, and you can edit the flows to fix some overload problem.
