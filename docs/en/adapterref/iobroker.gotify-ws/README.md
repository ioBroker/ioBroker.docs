This adapter uses the service `Sentry.io` to automatically report exceptions and code errors and new device schemas to me as the developer. More details see below!

## gotify-ws adapter for ioBroker

Gotify-WS is an adapter that establishes a websocket connection to a Gotify server and can therefore receive and process all messages from the server.

The background for me was a missing connection to all common systems.
For example, there is no proper app for IOS.

However, as Gotify is becoming more and more popular and has now also found its way into many systems such as Proxmox as a notification service, I needed a solution.

This is where Gotify-WS comes into play.
Gotify-WS receives messages and forwards them to a notification service supported by ioBroker. This means that messages can be forwarded to Telegram, for example.

Spotify-WS currently supports the following notification services

-   e-mail
-   Matrix
-   Notification-Manager
-   Pushover
-   Discord
-   Signal
-   Telegram
-   Whatsapp

## Adapter configuration

The configuration of the adapter is very simple.

You create a new client on your Gotify server and copy the generated token of the client.
You enter this in the Gotify-WS adapter configuration.
Gotify-WS also needs the IP address or domain and the port of the Gotify server.

This establishes a connection and the adapter can receive all incoming messages from the Gotify server.

You can then configure a notification service of your choice for forwarding.
