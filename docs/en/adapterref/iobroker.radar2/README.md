## ioBroker radar2 visibility testing for network and bluetooth devices, HP printers, UWZ-warnungs and ECB-currencies

This adapter tries to find the devices specified on the network or with bluetooth. It also shows the current external IP of the network, can read ink status of HP printers and also Weather warnings from UWZ for several european countries. It also can read daily currency exchange rates from ECB.

It works by:
* Using arp-scan and ping to lookup devices on the network with IPv4 und IPv6!
* Listening to dhcp messages which announces new devices coming to the network.
* It works on multiple interfaces which mean iof your system has Wlan and lan on different networks it can see both lans.
* Normal Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE is supported
* HP-printer ink-status
* European central bank currency exchange for Euero
* UWZ Weather warnings for the area where ioBroker is set to
* Uses arp-scan and ping on network as only expernal programs, everything else is internal to nodejs.
* The adapter works also without root rights but some configuration actions are required before installation

If you put a `-` at the end of a name the device will not be counted in the _notHere or _isHere.

If IP-address starts with 'http' radar2 will interpret it as an URL/web address and tries to read a page from the server, this can be used to test availability of web servers (like for example http://iobroker.net). In case of https it can happen that the server is not accessible if he does not have updated security keys!

To use UWZ you need to have your location configured in ioBroker.Admin!
If the value of max messages is >0 the each warning will be written in a separate state, otherwisde they will be combined.
You can also set if you want to use long warning text but all info is available in short one as well.

European Central Bank currencies can be seen here: `https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml` 

### Bluetooth usage

There are two different types of BT devices: BT-LE (V 4.x+) and normal BT (V<=3.x). The adapter has two different scan functions for each of the different device types.

 1) for BT-LE: Noble (Nodejs modile) and 'hcitool lescan' command
 2) for normal BT: BT scan (Nodejs module) and 'l2ping' command

Each BT device can use only one of the two methods of the same time.

Noble and BT scan are modules which are compiled on adapter installation with npm and the should work on linux and also most windows setups. 
Hcitool and l2ping are installed with the bluetooth tools in the setup script and available only for linux..

In the Adapter-config BT-LE macs schould be identified with a '!' before the mac-address to avoid scanning them with normal BT scans like l2ping.
Usually Noble is a bit better than hcitool lescan identifying devices but it generates also more errors and might not install on all systems.
Likewise l2ping is better finding normal BT devices but is not available on other platforms than linux.
Therefore you can configure the usage separately in adapter config.

If you use multiple BT devices you can specify the device number in config, the defailt is '-1' which uses the first available. A list of all available devices can be seen on linux with `lescan dev`.
In de same adapter you can use only one device, if you want to scan multiple devices you need to use differennt adapter(s or instances).

## Differences to radar-Adapter

Radar2 sets devices which are seen immediately when they become visible, for new ip's even before the scan starts again.
Radar2 uses nodejs-libraries to find bluetooth devices but it can run now also in user space from iobroker and does not need to get root access (see below installation requirements).
You can configure more than one IP (now IPv4 AND IPv6) address or host address (not URL's) in same line which allows you to ping on multiple ways to devices.
`arp-scan` is used to look for mac adresses, it will run (if not specified differently in it's command line) on all network interfaces which has external IPv4, so it will not detect devices based on mac addresses on IPv6, but it will now detect devices on wireless and fixed networks at the same time!

Availability of devices is handled differently. Each device will get a `_lasthere` state updated with current date & time whenever it is seen. At the end of each scan the adapter check all lasthere entries if they are older than the current time - the configured minutes of absence. Devecies which never have been here will also not have a `_lasthere` state! 

Web URL's can better manage now https servers.
The mac address vendor resolution is now done internally and not via the web. Only on adapter start file lib/vendor.json is loaded, if this file gets older than 31 days then a new version is downloaded from web - ONLY at adapter start!

The bluetooth part have been updated in a way that you can define the bluetooth device to be used (0,1, ... default: -1=first). In this way you can use multiple BT sticks to run multiple adapters like BLE and radar2 on the same device (bluetooth LE drivers for one device cannot be accessed by multiple programs at the same time).

If ip addresses or bluetooth devices  are found which you did not specify in your device list they will be shown in unknown IP and BT lists and a state will be generated for each of them. In this way you can identify people loggingh into your network or ned devices which can be integrated.
If you do not want to get them listed as unknown put them into the respective known IP/BT lists in adapter config.

Also new is that intervals for HP-Printer, ECB-, UWZ- and normal scans can be defined separately.

## Installation

Before installing the adapter into ioBroker you need to install on linux `arp-scan` and `libcap2-bin` and some drivers which you can do by running below commands.
On Debian (Raspi-Stretch, Ubuntu, ...) it looks like:
```
sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin arp-scan bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev net-tools
sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_net_bind_service=+eip $(eval readlink -f `which arp-scan`)
sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_net_bind_service=+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_net_bind_service=+eip $(eval readlink -f `which arp`)
sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_net_bind_service=+eip $(eval readlink -f `which hcitool`)
sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_net_bind_service=+eip $(eval readlink -f `which hciconfig`)
sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_net_bind_service=+eip $(eval readlink -f `which l2ping`)
```

If you update node or some system tools the above should be executed again!

On Windows (and maybe osx) there is no arp-scan which means that only ping will be used but no IP-mac addresses can be scanned!

On Osx also bluetooth may not work at all!

After installation setup adapter config, you can remove the demo line items.

### Special information for arp-scan:
There is a standard command line `-lgq --retry=5 --timeout=400` defined which would scan on all IPv4 interfaces all 254 addresses if it won't answer within 400ms it would retry 5 times!
If you need to scan s specific interface only you can add for example ` --interface=br0` but normally bridge interfaces are used now rightfully, but still in docker environments iot might be necessary.The repeat=5 can be changed to 6 or 7 for better detection, above 7 I did not find improvement! The same is with the timeout, above 500 I could not find any improvement. 

### Tip for those moving from radar to radar2-adapter or from machine one to another machine

* If you move radar adapters you can easily copy whole device list or settings by
* - Go in admin to objects and enable expert mode
* - Look for an object tree which is called `system.adapter.radar.0` (where `0` is the instance, if you had multiple instgances select the right one)
* - On the very right of this line is a buttom with a pencil, click on it
* - On the window you get select NATIVE
* - you should see then the config fields, select the content of the 'devices' field and copy it to the clipboard
* - do the same on destination machine selecting `system.adapter.radar2.0` in Admin/objects and go here also to NATIVE.
* - Delete the text in the 'devices' field and past in the old ones from clipboard
* - save the changes

This methodology of moving settings is working also between systems but may not work if other adapter has different structure. The device list is the same for radar and radar2, the only difference is that in radar2 you can have multiple ip addresses/entry separated by ','.

## Important/Wichtig
* Adapter needs node >= v6.*!
* Adapter may not be available to use bluetooth and arp-scan on osx, only ping ror ip which cannot detect IP mac adresses!
* Adapter may have problems with bluetooth on windows as well, also arp-scan is not available on windows, will use only ping then which cannot detect IP mac adresses!.
