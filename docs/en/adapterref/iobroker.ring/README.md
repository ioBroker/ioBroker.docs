The Ring adapter works with Ring devices like the Ring Video Doorbell and Ring Cam and shows if someone rings the
doorbell or if motion is detected.
The Ring Video Doorbell or Cam sends a videostream if a motion or doorbell is detected.

## Install & Configuration

After installing the Adapter, you have to enter your Token.
Ring now requires the use of Two-Factor Authentication (2fa) for all accounts.
For getting the token, please do following on your shell.

```shell
npx -p ring-client-api ring-auth-cli
```

or

```
# Unix 
cd /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.ring/
npm i ring-client-api

cd /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.ring/node_modules/ring-client-api
node ring-auth-cli
```

You can use special variables for your livestream and snapshot path and filename. These variables will be replaced with
a counter, timestamp, ring id or kind of ring.

* `%d`: Unix timestamp. Example: `test_%d -> test_1588331430061`
* `%g`: Formatted dated YYYYMMDD. Example: `test_%g -> test_20240614`
* `%t`: Formatted time HHiiss. Example: `test_%t -> test_235901`
* `%i`: ID of your ring device: Example: `test_%i -> test_234567890`
* `%n`: Counter since ring instance start. Example: `test_%n -> test_1`
* `%k`: Kind of your ring device: Example: `test_%k -> test_doorbell`

### FAQ

#### I don't receive events, snapshots and videos on motion or detected person

Congrats, it's very likely that your current token was put on a blacklist by ring, denying you the push notification you
would need.
The best way to resolve this is to remove any previous browsers/adapter tokens on the ring website and generate a new
token for the adapter.

In order for this adapter to properly react on events, Ring must send the push notification to the
used [Ring Api Client](https://github.com/dgreif/ring) for this adapter to react on it. The logic in this adapter was
checked multiple times and works for plenty of users, so if you experience issues regarding missing events, it's
unlikely
the fault of this adapter.

### V5 Breaking Changes

1. Some datapoints got renamed to be more consistent (e.g. `livestream_request` got reduced to `request` as it already
   is in channel `livestream`).
2. You can now configure wether you want to react on events (with recording, snapshot, ...) or not.
3. Binary states got removed.

### V3 Rewrite Breaking Changes

1. The Device Names got extended by their description (e.g., from `Device 1234567`
   to `Device 1234567 ("Floodlight Garden")`)
2. Snapshot/Livestream Data is now in a respective channel, containing the other data points.
3. The snapshot/livestream object got changed from type meta to state with type file.
4. Events (Motion, Ding, etc.) are now in the respective channel.
5. Due to `ring-api` dropping the support for node before `v16.x` this adapter needs `node v16.x` or `node v18.x`
6. Active refreshes are reduced to once every 2 hours, as we are listening/reacting to events.

### SIP (before Version 3.x)

You can use the SIP Information for a SIP Video Conference with your SIP client.
The adapter will not provide all ring devices because the used API does not include all ring devices.

You can use, for example, the Blink SIP client on [http://icanblink.com/](http://icanblink.com/).
To get video working go into Blink's Preferences and under "Accounts", switch the tab to "Media" and deselect "Encrypt
audio and video" under "RTP Options".
Be careful, the SIP information expires after a few seconds!
Hopefully I will be able to support a video stream soon.
Unfortunately, [ring.com](https://ring.com) does not have an official API that support this feature.
If you press the `livestream request` button you get new SIP Information for building up a SIP Video Call session.
If you are using the [ring.com](https://ring.com) cloud, you find under history a http link to your last motion /
doorbell recorded video.
