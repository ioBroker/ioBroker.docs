## iqontrol adapter for ioBroker

Fast Web-App for Visualization.

![Example](img/screenshot4.jpg)
![Example](img/screenshot3.jpg)

Runs in any Browser.
It's fully customizable.

## Add to Homescreen
You can save it as Web-App on Homescreen and it looks and feels like a native app:
![Add to Homescreeen](img/add_to_homescreen.png)


## You need...
* Nodejs 8 or higher
* Web-Adapter with one instance running the same protocol (http or https) as the admin-adapter, socket.IO set to 'integrated' and 'Force Web-Sockets' disabled
    * If this stands in conflict to other adapters, simply add another instance with the above settings - iQontrol will search the besst fitting web-adapter-instance and use it for communication
	* For connecting over *iobroker.pro-Cloud* both, admin- and web-adapter should be set to http (not https)


## Troubleshooting
* Make shure you fulfilled the 'You need...' section at top of this page
* If something doesn't work like expected after update please try the following steps:
    * Start upload of adapter:
    \
        ![Upload](img/adapter_upload.png)
	* Clear browser cache
	* Restart ioBroker
* Start iQonrol with opened debugging-console of your browser (mostly you need to press F12 to open it) and look for messages in the console-window

## How to use
* Start creating views.
	You can consider views as something like a page.
* Then create devices on these views.
	Devices have a role, that determines the function of the device, which icons are used and so on.
	Depending on that role you can link several states to the device. These will give the device its functionality.
	If you select 'Link to other view' as role you can create links to other views. I suggest skinning Links to other views with the same Background, the linked view has.
	You can also try to use the Autocreate-Function to choose an existing device from the iobroker-object-tree. Autocreate tries to find out the role and to match as many states as possible.
* Afterwards you can create a toolbar, which is displayed as footer.
	Toolbar-Entrys are links to views.
	The first Toolbar-Entry will be your 'Home-View' with will be loaded at start.
* To give everything a fancy style, you can upload your own images.
	You can use your images as background-images for views, or for devices.
	Images in the folder '/usericons' can be used as icons for devices.
	The free builtin demo-wallpapers are from www.pexels.com.


## URL-Parameters
* The frontend is called via ``http[s]://<url or ip of iobroker>:<port of web adapter>/iqontrol/index.html``
    * ``<port of web adapter>`` is usually 8082
* To open a specified instance you can add ``namespace=iqontrol.<instance-number>`` as URL-parameter
* To open a specified view as homepage you can add ``home=<viewID>`` as URL-parameter

**Example:**
* ``https://192.168.1.1:8082/iqontrol/index.html?namespace=iqontrol.1&home=iqontrol.1.Views.Living-Room``
    * Note upper and lower case


## Description of roles and associated states
Every device has a role, which defines the function of the device. Every role generates a set of states, which can be linked to a corresponding io-broker state.
If you use the auto-create-function, you can choose an existing device from the io-broker-object tree.  Autocreate tries to find out the role and to match as many states as possible.
This will only work for known devices. For unknown devices, and to give devices advanced features, you can add them manually via the (+)-Button or edit the devices that were created by autocreate.
To edit the role and the states of a device, click on the pencil behind the device. You will find a short description of the roles and the used states below:

### Modifying Datapoint Configuration
You can modify the configuration of datapoints via the wrench-icon behind a datapoint in the device-configuration dialog or in objects-tab of iobroker. Here you can:
* Set Readonly-Flag
* Set Invert-Flag
* Set Confirm-Flag (forces the user to confirm before a change is written to a datapoint)
* Set PIN-Code (forces the user to enter this PIN-Code before a change is written to a datapoint - but take care: this is only of low security, because the pin is checked in frontend! Use a number to display a fullscreen-pin-pad if asked for code)
* Set a datapoint id, where target values are written to (if you have different data points for the actual and the target value)
* Modify unit of datapoint, seperate for zero, singular and plural values
* Modify min and max of datapoint
* Modify type of datapoint
* Modify role of datapoint
* Set or modify a Value-List
  
![CustomDialog Call](img/custom_call.png)
![CustomDialog Example](img/custom_dialog.png)
  
### General states:
Every role has the following three states:
* **ADDITIONAL_INFO**: *array* - an array of datapoints, that will be displayed at the bottom of the info-dialog
* **BATTERY**: *boolean* - when true or *number* - when less than 10%, a little battery-empty-icon will be displayed
* **ERROR**: *boolean* - when true, a little exclamation-mark-icon will be displayed
* **UNREACH**: *boolean* - when true, a little wireless-icon will be displayed

Almost all roles have a STATE- and/or a LEVEL-state. In most cases this represents the main function of the device. You can assign io-broker-states of the following types to it:
* *boolean* - if possible, it will be translated to a senseful text like 'on/off', 'opened/closed' or similar. If you click on the icon of a tile it tries to toggle the boolean (for example to turn a light on or off). If it is not read-only it will generate a flip-switch in the dialog
* *number* - will be displayed with its corresponding unit and generate a slider in the dialog
* *string* - a text to be displayed
* *value-list* - the selected value will be displayed. If it is not write-protected it will generate a drop-down-menu in dialog 
    * Technically a *value-list* is a value with a corresponding translation-list, defined in the 'common.custom.iqontrol.<instance>.states', 'native.states' or 'common.states' object of the datapoint:
        ````
        "native": {
            "states": {"true": "Text for true", "false": "Text for false"},
            ...
        }
        ````
    * You can create your own value list by modifying the datapoint (wrench-icon behind the datapoint in the objects-tab of iobroker, see above)

However, not every type makes sense to every role. So the STATE of a switch for example will be a boolean in most cases, to be able to be toggled between on and off. A string may be displayed, but the switch will not be functional.

### Link to other view:
* Has no further states
* The **linked-view-property** is opened directly

### <img src="img/icons/switch_on.png" width="32"> Switch, <img src="img/icons/fan_on.png" width="32"> Fan:
* **STATE**: *boolean* - display and set on/off-state
* **POWER**: *number* - power-consumption that will be displayed in small in the upper right corner

### <img src="img/icons/button.png" width="32"> Button:
* **STATE**: *any* - any desired type of state
* **SET_VALUE**: CONSTANT *string* - this is a constant (not a linked io-broker-state!) that will be assigned to the STATE if the button is pressed
* **OFF_SET_VALUE**: CONSTANT *string* - this is a constant (not a linked io-broker-state!). If defined, STATE will be resetted to this value after the in options defined time or 100ms

### <img src="img/icons/light_on.png" width="32"> Light:
Every light may have one or both of the following states:
* **STATE**: *boolean* - show and set on/off-state
* **LEVEL**: *number* - show and set the level of the light

Optional you can define the following states:
* For coloured LEDs (HSB-color-space):
    * **HUE**: *number* - color of the light from 0-360Â° (hue format)
    * **SATURATION**: *number* - saturation of the light (from white to pure color)
    * **COLOR_BRIGHTNESS**: *number* - the brightness of the colored LEDs (if you have a LEVEL-State and no white LEDs, this is ignored, because brightness is controled completely by LEVEL)
* For white LEDs:
    * **CT**: *number* - color-temperature of the light, if it has two shades of white
    * **WHITE_BRIGHTNESS**: *number* - the brightness of the white LEDs (if you have a LEVEL-State and no coloured LEDs, this is ignored, because brightness is controled completely by LEVEL)
* Alternative color-spaces:
    * **ALTERNATIVE_COLORSPACE_VALUE**: *string* or *number* (depending on the chosed colorspace) - the value of the alternative colorspace
    If your device does not support using HUE, SATURATION and COLOR_BRIGHTNESS (HSB/HSV-color-space) you can use a variety of alternative colorspaces. In the device-options you can chose one of the following colorspaces:	
        * **RGB** / **#RGB**: instead of using HUE, SATURATION and COLOR_BRIGHTNESS you can use the RGB-Format (hex), optional with leading '#'
        * **RGBW** / **#RGBW**: instead of using HUE, SATURATION, COLOR_BRIGHTNESS and WHITE_BRIGHTNESS you can use the RGBW-Format (hex), optional with leading '#'
        * **RGBWWCW** / **#RGBWWCW** / **RGBCWWW** / **#RGBCWWW**: instead of HUE, SATURATION, COLOR_BRIGHTNESS, CT and WHITE_BRIGHTNESS you can use the RGBWWCW- or RGBCWWW-Format (hex, WW = warm white, CW = cold white), optional with leading '#'
        * **RGB (Hue only)** / **#RGB (Hue only)**: instead of using HUE you can use the RGB (Hue only)-Format (hex), optional with leading '#'. In this special case the RGB-Format will only accept pure saturated colors of the hue-color-circle. Mixed white is not allowed
        * **Hue for Milight**: This is the Hue-Value for Milight-Devices, with use another starting-point in the hue color-cirlce: 
            ````
    		MilightHue = modulo(66 - (hue / 3.60), 100) * 2.55; 
    		hue = modulo(-3.60 * (MilightHue/2.55 - 66), 360);
    		function modulo(n, m){ return ((n % m) + m) %m; }
            ````
	Keep in Mind: Conversion to alternative colorspace is done by frontend, so it is only active, if iQontrol is opened somewhere. Therefore you can't use it as a converter for colorspaces. To avoid conversation-loops it is recommendet to either use the original colorspace-datapoints (HUE, SATURATION, COLOR_BRIGHTNESS, CT, WHITE_BRIGHTNESS) *or* the alternative colorspace-datapoint to *replace* these datapoints. 
* Effect-Mode:
    * **EFFECT**: *value-list* - the effect to play
	* **EFFECT_NEXT**: *boolean* - if set to true, the next effect will play (as an alternative for devices that dont support EFFECT-value list)
	* **EFFECT_SPEED_UP** / **EFFECT_SPEED_DOWN**: *boolean* - if set to true, the effect will speed up/down
* Miscellaneous:
    * **POWER**: *number* - power-consumption that will be displayed in small in the upper right corner
