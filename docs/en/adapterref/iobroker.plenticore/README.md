# ioBroker.plenticore

An ioBroker adapter for KOSTAL Plenticore Plus inverter (i. e. Plenticore Plus 8.5)

This adapter uses the internal web interface of the inverter to access the properties and settings of your inverter and connected devices (e. g. battery or smart energy meter). To use the adapter you need to have the ioBroker instance connected to the network your KOSTAL Plenticore is in.

This adapter is NOT an official product of KOSTAL neither it is supported or endoresed by KOSTAL. It is a private project still in early development state, so use at your own risk!

## Config

Set the IP address of your inverter (e. g. 192.168.0.23) and your password you are using to connect as plant owner to the inverter's web interface. The polling interval is in milliseconds (i. e. 10000 is 10 seconds).

## Adapter 

The adapter does not use screenscraping. It uses the same REST API that the web interface does. There might be (lots of) features that are not (yet) used by the adapter.

### Why not (simply) use modbus?

The inverter has modbus tcp enabled so you could use the modbus adapter to query values. KOSTAL has not allowed writing any of the modbus addresses, though. So you can't set e. g. battery minimum SoC using ioBroker.

### Using the adapter

The adapter should fill some objects under the plenticore.X object tree. Some of those are read-only, e. g. the current PV output or home power consumption. Others are changeable, e. g. the battery's minimum SoC or the battery management modes. I tested the adapter on the Plenticore Plus 10.

## Objects

Following is an excerpt of the most important objects used and filled by this adapter. All Settings marked with `[**]` should be editable but not all of them were tested and there might be bugs.

### plenticore.X.devices.local

The devices.local tree contains information about the inverter and possibly attached smart energy meter and / or battery.

`plenticore.X.devices.local.Dc_P` - the current DC power including the self-used power of the inverter. This value should be near the value of `plenticore.X.devices.local.ac.P` (about +30-40W)  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.Pv_P` - the current PV power generated. This value is calculated by the adapter by summing up the pvx.P values.  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.Home_P` - the current total home power used  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.HomeBat_P` - the current home power provided by the battery  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.HomePv_P` - the current home power directly provided by the plant  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.HomeGrid_P` - the current home power provided by the grid  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.ToGrid_P` - the current power sent to the grid. This value is calculated by the adapter and may not be 100% acurate.  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.LimitEvuAbs` - the calculated current limit of power that may leave the converter. if more power is generated by the plant it will be lost.  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.StateKey0` - if true the battery management of the inverter has been unlocked

`[**] plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.MinSoc` - the desired minimum SoC (State of Charge) of the battery. The actual SoC might go below this if there is lacking sun power.  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.MinSocDummy` - This value is set by the adapter if the MinSoC management is disabled in the config. It is to show to what value the MinSoC would be set.  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.P` - the current battery power (negative if charging, positive if discharging)  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.Charge_P` - the current battery charging power (0 if discharging)  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.Discharge_P` - the current battery discharging power (0 if charging)  
`[**] plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.SmartBatteryControl` - true if the smart battery management is enabled. Regarding the official manual this shall only be enabled if there is no further AC source like a second inverter involved  
`[**] plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.ExternControl` - 0 to enable internal control, 1 for external digital I/O, 2 for external Modbus TCP

## Forecast data

To power forecast feature uses different weather data sources. It works out-of-the-box but you can improve the results by adding instances of one or more of the following weather adapters: ioBroker.darksky, ioBroker.weatherunderground, ioBroker.daswetter. For the feature to work you need to have the system's global geo position (longitude and latitude) configured and set the extended config of the plenticore adapter (panel and battery data if applicable).

### How does the forecast work

The forecast feature uses the provided data of your power plant and battery to calculate the maximum possible power generated at each time of the day. This is done by using the system's location to get the sun elevation and azimuth and calculate solar radiance values. Those values are combined with weather forecast data from different sources to get the cloudiness, fog and rain forecast for each hour of the day. Using those data the adapter calculates a possible power the plant might be able to generate in each our of sunlight.

The forecast values can then be used to set the MinSoC of the battery, enable or disable the dynamic "intelligent battery management" of the converter (both done internally by the adapter) or control other decives in the household, e. g. heating, washing machine, dryer, dishwasher etc. (done by external JavaScript/Blockly of the user).
