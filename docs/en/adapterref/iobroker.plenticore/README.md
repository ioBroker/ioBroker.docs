# ioBroker.plenticore


An ioBroker adapter for KOSTAL Plenticore Plus inverter (i. e. Plenticore Plus 8.5)

This adapter uses the internal web interface of the inverter to access the properties and settings of your inverter and connected devices (e. g. battery or smart energy meter). To use the adapter you need to have the ioBroker instance connected to the network your KOSTAL Plenticore is in.

This adapter is NOT an official product of KOSTAL neither it is supported or endoresed by KOSTAL. It is a private project still in early development state, so use at your own risk!

## Config

Set the IP address of your inverter (e. g. 192.168.0.23) and your password you are using to connect as plant owner to the inverter's web interface. The polling interval is in milliseconds (i. e. 10000 is 10 seconds).

## Adapter 

The adapter does not use screenscraping. It uses the same REST API that the web interface does. There might be (lots of) features that are not (yet) used by the adapter.

### Why not (simply) use modbus?

The inverter has modbus tcp enabled so you could use the modbus adapter to query values. KOSTAL has not allowed writing any of the modbus addresses, though. So you can't set e. g. battery minimum SoC using ioBroker.

### Using the adapter

The adapter should fill some objects under the plenticore.X object tree. Some of those are read-only, e. g. the current PV output or home power consumption. Others are changeable, e. g. the battery's minimum SoC or the battery management modes. I tested the adapter on the Plenticore Plus 10.

I have not yet implemented all the API endpoints, especially the energy flow statistics that are used for the "statistics" page on the web interface. Also the adapter is highly lacking translations as I am completely new to developing for ioBroker.

## Objects

Following is an excerpt of the most important objects used and filled by this adapter. All Settings marked with `[**]` should be editable but not all of them were tested and there may be (and will be) bugs.

### plenticore.X.devices.local

The devices.local tree contains information about the inverter and possibly attached smart energy meter and / or battery.

`plenticore.X.devices.local.Dc_P` - the current DC power including the self-used power of the inverter. This value should be near the value of `plenticore.X.devices.local.ac.P` (about +30-40W)  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.Home_P` - the current total home power used  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.HomeBat_P` - the current home power provided by the battery  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.HomePv_P` - the current home power directly provided by the plant  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.HomeGrid_P` - the current home power provided by the grid  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.LimitEvuAbs` - the calculated current limit of power sent to the grid. if more power is generated by the plant it will be lost.  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.StateKey0` - if true the battery management of the inverter has been unlocked


#### plenticore.X.devices.local.ac

This channel contains information about the AC side of the inverter. Most important are:  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.ac.Frequency` - the net frequency  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.ac.L1_P` - the current power of phase 1 in W  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.ac.L2_P` - the current power of phase 2 in W  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.ac.L3_P` - the current power of phase 3 in W  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.ac.P` - the current total power emitted by the inverter, including battery discharge

#### plenticore.X.devices.local.battery

`plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.Cycles` - the lifetime battery cycles up to now

`[**] plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.MinSoc` - the desired minimum SoC (State of Charge) of the battery. The actual SoC might go below this if there is lacking sun power.  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.P` - the current battery power (negative if charging, positive if discharging)  
`[**] plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.SmartBatteryControl` - true if the smart battery management is enabled. Regarding the official manual this shall only be enabled if there is no further AC source like a second inverter involved  
`plenticore.X.devices.local.battery.SoC` - the current state of charge of the battery  

#### plenticore.X.devices.local.inverter

`plenticore.X.devices.local.inverter.MaxApparentPower` - the maximum power that the inverter can provide

#### plenticore.X.devices.local.pv1 / pv2

`plenticore.X.devices.local.pvX.P` - the current power that is provided by phase X of the plant

### plenticore.X.scb

#### plenticore.X.scb.modbus

`[**] plenticore.X.scb.modbus.ModbusEnable` - true if the modbus tcp is enabled  
`[**] plenticore.X.scb.modbus.ModbusUnitId` - modbus unit id of the device

#### plenticore.X.scb.network

`[**] plenticore.X.scb.network.Hostname` - the current host name of the inverter  
`[**] plenticore.X.scb.network.IPv4Auto` - use DHCP to provide the ip address settings for the inverter  
`[**] plenticore.X.scb.network.IPv4Address` - the current ip address of the inverter  
`[**] plenticore.X.scb.network.IPv4DNS1` and `plenticore.X.scb.network.IPv4DNS2` - the currently used DNS servers  
`[**] plenticore.X.scb.network.IPv4Gateway` - the currently used network gateway  
`[**] plenticore.X.scb.network.IPv4Subnetmask` - the network subnet mask  

#### plenticore.X.scb.time

`[**] plenticore.X.scb.time.NTPservers` - the currently used time servers (NTP). Those can be multiple ones separated by space.  
`[**] plenticore.X.scb.time.NTPuse` - use NTP to set current device time settings  
`[**] plenticore.X.scb.time.Timezone` - the time zone of the device

### plenticore.X.scb.statistic.EnergyFlow

The datapoints in this section contain the statistics that are visible in the Plenticore web UI. Following only the `Day` datapoints are mentioned, but each of them is also available for `Month`, `Year` and `Total`.
