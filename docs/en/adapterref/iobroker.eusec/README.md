This is an [ioBroker](https://www.iobroker.net) adapter that uses the [eufy-security-client](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-client) library to comunicate with Eufy devices.

**This project is not affiliated with Anker and Eufy (Eufy Security). It is a personal project that is maintained in spare time.**

## Description

This adapter allows to control [Eufy security devices](https://us.eufylife.com/collections/security) by connecting to the Eufy cloud servers and local/remote stations.

You need to provide your Cloud login credentials. The adapter connects to your cloud account and polls for all device data via HTTPS. Now a local or remote P2P connection to the Eufy stations/devices is also supported. However, a connection to the Eufy Cloud is always a prerequisite.

One Adapter instance will show all devices from one Eufy Cloud account and allows to control them.

## Documentation

Look [here](https://bropat.github.io/ioBroker.eusec/)

## Known working devices

Information about supported devices can be found [here](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-client#known-working-devices).

## How to report issues and feature requests

Please use GitHub issues for this.

Best is to set the adapter to Debug log mode (see [here](https://bropat.github.io/ioBroker.eusec/#/debugging)). Then please get the logfile from disk (subdirectory "log" in ioBroker installation directory and not from Admin because Admin cuts the lines).
