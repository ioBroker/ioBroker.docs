## webuntis adapter for ioBroker

Adapter to get data from WebUntis

Dieser Adapter bezieht Daten aus Webuntis. 
FÃ¼r eine deutsche Anleitung ![hier klicken](readme/readme.de.md)


## Getting started
After the install of the adapter in iobroker, automatically opens the Configuration-Window.

Now go to https://webuntis.com and take the schoolname in the searchfield.

![webuntis_start](readme/img/webuntis_start.png)

now you need to strings from the internet-adress of the schoolwebsite from webuntis:
- the base-url 
- the school-secret

see the example below the previous screenshot:
https://hepta.webuntis.com/WebUntis/?school=hbs-F%C3%BCrth#/basic/login

- hepta.webuntis.com    => the schoolbase-URL
- hbs-F%C3%BCrth        => the school-secret

**If in school-secret is a __+__ , then you must replace this character with a blank space**

now go to the configuration-window in iobroker

![webuntis_config](readme/img/webuntis_config.png)

after the insert of your Username (child or parent) and the password for this account, you can take 
the school-secret and the school-basr-Url to the configuration.

Save and at this moment you will become the lessons for the next day.

please feel free, to make a proposal for recommend versions.
