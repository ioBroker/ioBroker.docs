IoBroker Haier adapter is used to control your Haier air conditioning via UART in conjunction with the TCP to Serial Gateway.
The work is checked on the air conditioner of the 'Lightera' series.

## Hardware
As a TCP to Serial gateway, I use this [code](https://github.com/instalator/ESP8266.TelnetToSerial) and this [device](https://blog.instalator.ru/archives/433).
