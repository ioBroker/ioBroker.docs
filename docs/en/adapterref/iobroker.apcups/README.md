## Apc UPS adapter for ioBroker

Adapter for ioBroker to get information from APS UPSs via apcupsd.

apcupsd home page: http://www.apcupsd.org/

apcupsd is a daemon for controlling APC UPSes. Using this adaptor you can monitor UPS status and make some decisions based on the provided information.

**Install apcupsd on Ubuntu:**

sudo apt-get -y install apcupsd

More useful information about apcupsd config for Ubuntu you can find on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/apcupsd

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.
