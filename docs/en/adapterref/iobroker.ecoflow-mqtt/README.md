## ecoflow-mqtt adapter for ioBroker

connects to products of Ecoflow ([https://www.ecoflow.com])

## WARNING

This adapter uses a non-offical communication with the devices. 
Wrong communication or setting wrong values can affect the functionality of the device and may lead to exclusion from the service.


The adapter is based on the work of:
* my own evaluation and research
* https://github.com/tolwi/hassio-ecoflow-cloud
* https://haus-automatisierung.com/hardware/2023/02/13/ecoflow-river-2-usv-batteriespeicher.html
* https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/66743/ecoflow-connector-script-zur-dynamischen-leistungsanpassung
* https://konkludenz.de/en/making-ecoflow-wave2-smart-home-capable-with-node-red-and-mqtt


## Installation

The adapter is in stable repository and therefore you can install it by searching it.
If updates are available the you should install them.

If a very new version is available it might be neccesary to make a custom install from npm/github.
In such case the expert mode must be enabled to get access to the "octacat" icon.
![some more details](doc/en/installation.md)

## EF credentials 

In Admin Page (first tab) the mqqt credentials for the mqqt Broker need to be inserted.
* UserName - something like "app-...."
* UserID - a 19 digit number
* UserPassword - an alphanumeric
* ClientID - a string starting with "ANDROID_...."

There are 3 possibilities:
1. by script https://github.com/mmiller7/ecoflow-withoutflow/blob/main/cloud-mqtt/ecoflow_get_mqtt_login.sh
2. by website https://energychain.github.io/site_ecoflow_mqtt_credentials/
3. by adapters own alogorithm (pressing the button), for this the ecoflow username and password is necessary.

The mqqt Broker settings are default and usually need no modification.

Modification at HA side:

* The adapter uses the discovery function in HA, no configuration of datapoints in HA is needed.
* MQTT add-on ...

</p></details>

## Updating the adapter

Usually it is enough to install the next version on top of the old one. In some cases (e.g. 1.0.0) it might be needed to erase the whole object tree.
If datapoint related values are changed, like min or max of the range, the you have to:
- stop the adapter
- deleted the concerned datapoints
- start the adapter
After this the new ranges are taken over.

## ioBroker adapter functions 

* the defined devices are connected to the adapter via mqtt
* the adapter filters the incomming messages of the devices. only changed values are stored internally
* if the App prevents adjusting at a certain condition, when known it is replicated (e.g. inverter ON when below minimum battery charge is prevented, you can see a warning in the log )
* not everything is known, so information to status interpretation may be uncertain, this is mostly marked with trailing "?"

### remarks to update of data point setup (min, max, unit, ....)

If settings to a data point are changed in the new version of adapter (e.g. name, unit, max value) the change is not effective until you:
- stop the adapter instance
- delete the respective datapoint or the whole object structure of the adapter instance
- start the adapter instance

During startup the datapoints are created, but not changed when existing.

### remarks to warnings/errors

Some occurances in the adapter are tagged as warning or error in order to appear in the log when the loglevel is in info mode.
This is not necessarily a failure or an indicator for not working adapter, it is more a sign for a not expected behaviour. The cause might not be in the adapter itself, but the attention is set.

## HA connector/gateway

* the MQTT discovery function in HA enables an elegant way of information exchange
* the MQTT discovery function may not be activated when MQTT broker is already running in HA, it needs to be enabled during reconfiguration of MQTT service
* at each start of iobroker adapter all discovery objects are transmitted to HA (even they should retain in HA)
* iobroker adapter filters the incomming messages of the devices. only changed values are stored internally and transferred to HA.
* if a value is not set by device data update, it will appear as unknown in HA
* if the device is reachable, then the availability will be shown in the device connectivity, this is inherited to the "sub-devices" (unavailability is precessed in the same way)

### annotations to functionality

* Due to to the asynchronity of information updates and command transfer sometimes race conditions may be visible. So a switch is commanded and its toggling back and forth before it stays, can be observed.
* restart of HA may not be recognized correctly in iobroker, so it needs a manual restart of the adapter (WIP)

## Implemented Devices & Structure with Datapoints

some explanation to the device data
* number -> data point with numeric value
* level -> adjustable data point with numeric value, sometimes also selections which have numeric representation
* switch -> adjustable data point boolean
* diagnostic -> boolean or multi state data point transferred to text
* string -> datapoint as text only
* array -> datapoint with array
* value to text conversion might use a non-validated text (feedback is welcome), this is indicated be "?" at the end of text
