## unifi-network adapter for ioBroker

Unifi Network uses the websocket interface to receive real-time information from the unifi-network application

## Important

1. The adapter is developed exclusively on the basis of the UniFi OS. Compatibility with a self-hosted network controller should be given, but cannot be guaranteed.

2. **This adapter can be very resource intensive!**<br>This depends on your environment, i.e. how many unifi-devices and clients are in your network. This can be influenced somewhat via the realtime api `debounce time [s]` parameter in the adapter settings. Real-time events are not affected by this setting, only the "cyclical" real time update of devices, clients, etc.

3. **Not all states are directly available after the adapter has started**<br>States are only created and updated when the data is sent by the network controller, this can take some time until the data is sent for the first time

## Configuration

### Local user (UniFi OS)

You will need a local user created in your UniFi OS Console to log in with. Ubiquiti SSO Cloud Users will not work. It is recommended you use the Administrator or a user with full read/write access to get the most out of the integration, but it is not required.

1. Login to your Local Portal on your UniFi OS device, and click on Users.\
   **Note**: This **must** be done from the UniFi OS by accessing it directly by IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.1), not via unifi.ui.com or within the UniFi Network app.

2. Go to **Admins & Users** from the left hand side menu and select the Admins tab or go to [IP address]/admins/ (e.g. 192.168.1.1/admins/).

3. Click on **+** in the top right corner and select **Add Admin**.

4. Select **Restrict to local access only** and enter a new username and password.

5. Select **Hotspot Operator** and **Site Admin** for the Network role.\
   **Note** This is not absolutely necessary, if the permissions are not sufficient, you will be informed via log message
