# ioBroker.notificationforandroidtv - Benachrichtigungsintegration f√ºr Android TV/Fire TV

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/iobroker.notificationforandroidtv.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/iobroker.notificationforandroidtv/)

Notification integration for IoBroker includes support for Notifications for [Android TV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.cyberdream.androidtv.notifications.google) and Notifications for [Fire TV](https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Fees-Notifications-for-Fire/dp/B00OESCXEK). With this integration, you can send notifications to your Android TV device. It enables an overlay displaying the message content for a customizable duration before disappearing. Additionally, it supports sending images, such as those from security cameras, and custom icons. Icons function similarly to images, appearing smaller and to the left of the notification, while images display larger and above the notification.

These notifications operate within the global scope of your Android TV device, appearing regardless of the active application.

During setup, note that there are two distinct apps: one for your smartphone (which isn't necessary for this platform) and another for your Android TV device to receive notifications. The app required for displaying notifications sent from IoBroker is available in the store of your Android TV device. Any in-app purchases are exclusive to the client for Android smartphones and do not restrict pushing notifications from IoBroker.

From version 3.0.0, our notification integration also supports [PiPup](https://github.com/rogro82/PiPup). PiPup can be utilized to transmit video streams, for example, from cameras, or to overlay websites onto your Android TV screen. It provides a versatile solution for integrating various content seamlessly into your Android TV experience.

## Description
The notification integration for IoBroker supports sending notifications to Android TV and Fire TV devices. This integration allows customizable message overlays to be displayed on the TV screen for a specified duration. Additionally, it can display images, such as those from security cameras, and custom icons. Furthermore, it introduces a new feature to stream videos and web content seamlessly to your Android TV or Fire TV device. This means you can use PiPup to broadcast video streams, such as those from cameras, or overlay websites directly onto your TV screen.

## Setup Steps:

### 1. Adapter Settings:
- Go to the adapter settings in the IoBroker interface.
- Add the IP addresses of the target devices and give them names for identification.

### 2. Download the App on Your Android TV / Fire TV:
- Download the "Notifications for Android TV" app for Android TV devices from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.cyberdream.androidtv.notifications.google).
- Download the "Notifications for Fire TV" app for Fire TV devices from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Fees-Notifications-for-Fire/dp/B00OESCXEK).

### 4. Sending Messages:
- Once a message is entered in the "message" object or under "payload," it will be sent to the TV device. Payload only uses the IP address from the objects; the rest must be passed through the payload object.
- The same applies to PiPup; here the URL is also transmitted when a message is entered.

### 5. PiPup Installation Guide

## For Android TV Users

Please follow the instructions at [PiPup GitHub](https://github.com/rogro82/PiPup) for Android TV.

## For Fire TV or other Android TV without Google Play Store

1. Install an app like [atvTools](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/atvtools/id1661419573) on your smartphone.
2. Download the [PiPup apk files](https://github.com/desertblade/PiPup/releases) on your smartphone.
3. Transfer the apk files to your Android TV.

### Using adb Commands

Ensure that your Android TV is connected to the same network as your smartphone, and your Android TV has [developer options](https://www.firesticktricks.com/developer-options-firestick.html) enabled.
