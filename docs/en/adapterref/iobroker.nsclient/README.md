# NSCLIENT adapter configuration and usage

## General information and features

This adapter allows automatic polling of client systems equipped with NsClient++ agent and store the results in multiple states. So (for example) the following cleint data will be available within ioBroker:

- system uptime
- cpu load in percent for several time ranges
- memory load for several time ranges
- discspace with absolute values and as percentage values

Additionally every check returns a binary status and a textual status message.

This adapter supports an unlimited number of devices with configurable polling interval.

## Requirements

This adapter requires an NsClient++ agent to be installed at the target system. This agent is available for Windows (tested with Windows 10 and Windows 11) and Linux. The NsClient++ software is describes and available [here](https://nsclient.org/) free of charge.

__ATTENTION:__ The required nsclient agent is not activly maintained but stills works stable at Win10 / Win11 and is used in nagios network monitoring based environments.

## Downloading and installing the NsClient++ agent 

### Download client agent software

__IMPORTANT:__ Please note the nsclient++ agent software is neither developed nor maintained by ioBroker team. The ioBroker developmentteam cannot take any resonsibilty for any damage or security risk caused by nclient++ software.

### Installing on windows systems

You can download the nsclient installation kits [here](https://nsclient.org/download/). Please select the package matching you operating system.

* After downloading the nsclient++ software from [nsclient++ homepage](https://nsclient.org/) start the installation by executing the downloaded image (i.e. NSCP-0.5.2.35-x64.msi).

* When prompted select monitoring tool - generic

* Select installation type typical

<p align=center><img src="img/agentInstall-002.png" alt="install-002" width="300" /></p>

* Add the ip addresses of those hosts which should be allowed to connect to the agent. You can add a list of ip addresses seperated by comma. For details see [nsclient++ documentation](https://docs.nsclient.org/web/)

* set a secure password.  
__IMPORTANT: nsclient stores the password unencrypted. So never use a password used for some other access then the nsclient++ agent.__

* enable _common_ _check_ _plugins_ and _WEB_ _server_ (other modules are not required for ioBroker access, but feel free to install them if any other usage is intended.)

<p align=center><img src="img/agentInstall-003.png" alt="install-003" width="300" /></p>

* allow the installation to continiue and enter an admin password if requested by windows

* reboot the system to finalize the installation (yes, it's windows).

### Installing On Linux systems

Please see information at [nsclient++ homepage](https://nsclient.org) for details.

## Configuration of the NsClient++ agent 

* connect to nsclient++ web interface by opening https://localhost:8443. Authorize by using the password specified during installation.  
A description of the web UI can be found [in the documentation](https://docs.nsclient.org/web/)

* ensure that the required modules are loaded an enabled  
see the list of modules in the next picture

<p align=center><img src="img/agentConfig-000.png" alt="install-003" width="480" /></p>

* most likely you will have to load and enable some modules. To do this, click onto the line listing the module to open the module config. Mark _loaded_ and _enabled_ buttons.  
__Do not forget to save the changes__

<p align=center><img src="img/agentConfig-001.png" alt="config-001" width="480" /></p>

<p align=center><img src="img/agentConfig-002.png" alt="config-002" width="480" /></p>

<p align=center><img src="img/agentConfig-003.png" alt="config-003" width="480" /></p>

* feel free to enable others modules too.  
__WARNING:__ when enabling modules which can execute scripst at the target system security risks can arise. Be sure to understand how nsclient++ is working and how to avoid unauthorizes acess before enabling such modules. ioBoker.nsclient adapter does not support any action triggered at the target system.

## Configuration of the ioBroker.nsclient adapter

The configuratuon of the ioBroker.nsclient adapter is structured with several tabs. (Currently only tab _devices_ is used.)



### Tab _devices_

<p align=center><img src="img/admin-dev.jpg" alt="admin-dev" width="512" /></p>

The _devices_ tab is used to configure all devices which should be monitored by the instance. You can add a new table line for each device with the following data:

| Parameter     | Type        | Description                       | Comment                             |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| active        | boolean     | if set to true, the device will be used  | This can be used to disable a single device |
| Name          | text        | name of the device                | Parameter will be used to create name of data points. Names must be unique and must not end with a dot oder conatin consecutive dots. |
| IP address    | text        | ip address (IPv4 or IPv6) or a domain name with optional port number attached    | |
| Username       | text         | username to authenticate          | Note: nsclient requires username to be _admin_ currently |
| Password       | text         | password to authenticate          |                               |
| polling (sec) | number        | poll intervall in seconds         |                               |
| timeout (sec) | number        | processing timeout in seconds     |                               |
| check cpu     | boolean       | enable cpu related checks         |                               |
| check memory  | boolean       | enable memory related checks      |                               |
| check drives  | boolean       | enable drivespace related checks  |                               |

IoBroker state bjects will be created after successful polling the target device.
