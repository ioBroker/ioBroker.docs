## espresense adapter for ioBroker

Connect to [ESPresense](https://espresense.com)

- MQTT server and clientmodue 
- `Start own mqtt server` activate server mode
- `Server ip` use only for external mqtt server
- `Port, Username & Passowrd` of internal or external mqtt Server

- If devices have been added to the configuration, only these will be displayed in the objects. 
- The two configuration times are linked, the presence check always runs with the processing of the MQTT messages.

Best practice: Pair the devices to be monitored with espresense and filter the output to avoid unnecessary network traffic.

#### max_distance_iobroker
The newly added data points are used to achieve per-room detection in the adapter. When using max_distance in esp32, the adapter does not receive a notification when the device leaves the area. When using max_distance_iobroker, however, it does. 
If max_distance_iobroker is used, the two presense data points are controlled by it, otherwise they behave as before.
Presense under the device is true if one of the data points in the rooms below is true.

For help use issue or if u understand german https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/71189/test-adapter-espresense



* The mqtt-server used is a fully compatible MQTT 3.1 and 3.1.1 server, but the adapter only responds to the topic espresense/#
