This is an ioBroker Adapter to control the nanoleaf Light Panels (formerly nanoleaf Aurora) or nanoleaf Canvas through the nanoleaf OpenAPI.

## Connection to the nanoleaf Light Panels/Canvas Controller:
1. In the adapter settings you have to set the IP address and port of the nanoleaf Controller. The nanoleaf OpenAPI needs an authorization token to grant access to the REST-API. If you have already one, you can enter the token here and skip the next step.
2. If you don't have an authorization token you need to request it from the nanoleaf OpenAPI.
   To do this, set the nanoleaf Controller into pairing mode by pressing and holding the power button at the device for 5-7 seconds until the LEDs flash alternately.
   Then click on the button 'Obtain authorization token' within 30 seconds (pairing mode stops after 30 seconds). The adapter must be running!
   If it was successfull the authorization token should be seen in the field 'Authentification token'. If an error occured you get a pop up with the error message (details you can see in the log).
3. Save the settings.
4. Have fun!

Because the nanoleaf OpenAPI doesn't support long polling or websockets the only way to update the states is polling.
You can set the polling interval in the adapter settings.

## Alexa
You can control the nanoleaf Light Panels/Canvas with Alexa via ioBroker (Cloud-Adapter).
Power on/off, brightness, color and color temperature is supported.
You have to set up the datapoints
* state (for power on/off)
* hue (for color)
* saturation (for color)
* brightness (for color)
* colorTemp (for color temperature)

in Cloud adapter under the same smartname.

## ioBroker Visualization
The nanoleaf Light Panels/Canvas can be controlled in ioBroker Visualization by using basic widgets as "Radiobuttons on/off" or sliders for controlling the power sate, the brightness, hue, saturation and color temperature states.

For effects you can use the "Select ValueList" widget to use it as a drop down list and then map the effectsList state to the value and text property of the widget (type: "{nanoleaf-lightpanels.0.LightPanels.effectsList}" -> the curly braces are important!)

To control and visualize the color you have to install the color picker style Widgets. You can map the RGB ID to the colorRGB state or use the three HSV states as well.

You can use the nanoleaf vis demo project found in the /vis subfolder on github.
