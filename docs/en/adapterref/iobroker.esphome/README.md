**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## ESPHome adapter for ioBroker

Control your ESP8266/ESP32 with simple yet powerful configuration files created and managed by ESPHome.
Native integration of ESPHome managed device (Including Dashboard) by its native API and ensures all data is synchronized (live-event handling, no data polling ! :)

This adapter uses the [esphome-native-api](https://github.com/Nafaya/esphome-native-api#readme) with all credits to @Nafaya to interact with [ESPHome API](https://esphome.io/components/api.html?highlight=api)!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What's the difference between the ioBroker ESPHome Adapter and ESPHome Dashboard?

**ioBroker ESPHome Adapter:**
- Integrates your ESPHome devices into ioBroker for home automation control
- Communicates directly with ESP devices via ESPHome's native API
- Creates ioBroker states/objects for device control and monitoring
- Handles real-time device status updates (no polling required)
- Manages device configuration within ioBroker

**ESPHome Dashboard:**
- A web interface for creating, editing, and managing ESPHome device configurations
- Used for writing YAML configs, compiling firmware, and flashing devices
- Can be integrated into ioBroker's admin interface as an optional feature
- Can be run either integrated with this adapter or as an external installation (Docker, standalone)

**In Summary:** The adapter controls your devices within ioBroker, while the dashboard manages device configurations and firmware.

### How do I configure the Dashboard IP selector?

The Dashboard IP setting in the adapter configuration serves different purposes:

**For Integrated Dashboard Tab in ioBroker Admin:**
1. Enter the IP address and port where your ESPHome Dashboard is running
2. **Built-in Dashboard:** Use `127.0.0.1:6052` (default for integrated dashboard)
3. **External Dashboard:** Use the IP:port of your external ESPHome installation (e.g., Docker container)
4. **HTTPS Setup:** For HTTPS environments, see the detailed HTTPS configuration section below

**Dashboard IP Examples:**
- Built-in: `127.0.0.1:6052`
- External Docker: `192.168.1.100:6052`
- External Host: `esphome.local:6052`
- HTTPS Proxy: `https://192.168.1.50:8082/proxy.0/esphome/`

![ESPHome Dashboard IP Configuration](admin/img/ESPhomeDashboardIP.png)

**Note:** You can use this adapter to control ESPHome devices without configuring the Dashboard IP. The Dashboard IP is only needed if you want to integrate the ESPHome Dashboard interface into ioBroker's admin panel.

### Do I need the ESPHome Dashboard to use this adapter?

**No, the Dashboard is optional.** You can use this adapter in several ways:

1. **Adapter Only:** Control pre-configured ESPHome devices without any dashboard integration
2. **Adapter + External Dashboard:** Use your existing ESPHome installation (Docker, standalone) and optionally integrate it into ioBroker's interface
3. **Adapter + Built-in Dashboard:** Enable the integrated ESPHome Dashboard feature for a complete solution

The adapter works independently and only requires devices with ESPHome API enabled in their configuration.

### How do I add devices to the adapter?

1. **Ensure ESPHome API is enabled** in your device's YAML configuration (see Prerequisites section)
2. **Open the adapter's device tab** in ioBroker Admin (adapter must be running)
3. **Add devices manually:** Enter device IP address and authentication credentials
4. **Automatic discovery:** Currently disabled (see issue #175)

The adapter will establish a connection and create all necessary ioBroker objects for device control.

## [Documentation](https://DrozmotiX.github.io/languages/en/Adapter/ESPHome/)

All our adapter documentation can be found at [The DrozmotiX Docu Page](https://DrozmotiX.github.io/languages/en/Adapter/ESPHome/) 
-->

## Prerequisites

    * NodeJS >= 18.x
    * API is activated in YAML
    * For admin tabs (optional)
        * ESPHome Dashboard IP is provided in instance settings

## ESPHome Dashboard Integration (Optional)

This adapter can optionally integrate the ESPHome Dashboard into ioBroker's admin interface. You have several options:

**Option 1: Built-in Dashboard (Recommended for beginners)**
- Enable "Native Integration of ESPHome Dashboard" in adapter settings
- Uses integrated Python environment (no external setup required)
- Dashboard runs on port 6052 by default
- Set Dashboard IP to `127.0.0.1:6052` for admin integration

**Option 2: External Dashboard**
- Use existing ESPHome installation (Docker, standalone, etc.)
- Enter the external dashboard's IP:port in adapter settings
- Example: `192.168.1.100:6052` for Docker container

**Option 3: No Dashboard Integration**
- Skip dashboard configuration entirely
- Use external ESPHome tools for device configuration
- Adapter still controls devices normally

![Dashboard IP Configuration](admin/img/ESPhomeDashboardIP.png)

> **üí° See FAQ above** for detailed explanations about Dashboard IP configuration and adapter vs. dashboard differences.

### Using HTTPS

One reason to use HTTPS is to be able to flash directly to devices plugged into you pc, because esphome will not allow this with http (probably browser limitation with WebSerial).

![flashFromThisComputer.png](admin/img/flashFromThisComputer.png)

Using the integrated dashboard when the iobroker is using https currently requires some more steps:

1. install - if you don't have it already - web adapter and configure https. see web documentation for further information: [ioBroker.web](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.web)
2. install [proxy](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.proxy) adapter
3. configure the path in the proxy adapter settings:
   1. context: `esphome/`
   2. url: `http://localhost:6052`
![proxy.png](admin/img/proxy.png)
4. configure the full dashboard url in the advanced section of the esphome adapter settings - esphome dashboard:
   1. like: `https://<iobrokerIP>:<webAdapterPort>/proxy.0/esphome/`
   2. where `<iobrokerIP>` is the ip of the host where you iobroker is running (same as above)
   3. and `<webAdapterPort>` is the port of the web adapter (default is 8082)
   4. it should look something like this:
   ![ESPHomeDashboardUrl.png](admin/img/ESPHomeDashboardUrl.png)
   5. if you run the dashboard on an external host, you can also use the url to an external dashboard instance here

## How to use this adapter

### Activate API in YAML
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ioBroker ESPHome allows to integrate Devices by Encryption Key (recommended) or API-Password (legacy), 
> you must specify your authentication settings accordingly, 
> see [ESPHome Documentation](https://esphome.io/components/api.html?highlight=api)
> Please only configure Encryption Key (preferable) or API-Password (legacy)

#### Example Encryption Key configuration entry
```
api:
  encryption:
    key: "DyDfEgDzmA9GlK6ZuLkj3qgFcjXiZUzUf4chnIcjQto="
```

#### Example API configuration entry
```
api:
  password: 'MyPassword'
```

## Device Management

### Add / Modify / Remove ESPHome devices to ioBroker
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This adapter integrates communication with ESPHome capable devices and 
> (if activated) an integrated version of ESPHome Dashboard.
> You must configure and upload your ESP configuration by yourself, 
> either by using the integrated Dashboard or an external alternative 
> (like Docker) before they can be integrated to ioBroker

> **üí° See FAQ above** for step-by-step guidance on adding devices to the adapter.

The device Tab will show all current known devices; you can either wait for Devices to be autodetect
(currently disabled, see #175) or add them manually by providing their IP-Address and credentials

![DevicesTab](admin/img/deviceTabEmpty.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Buttons to add/modify/remove devices and load device table are only available if adapter is running!
> You must refresh the device table manually by pressing "Refresh device Overview", all devices and their connection state will be shown

Please enter IP-Address (if a device is already known, you can select it from the dropdown) and choose the proper actions:
- ADD / Modify Devices
  - Will send IP address and credentials to the backend and try to establish a connection
  - When an encryption Key is provided, API-Password is ignored, please ensure proper YAML configuration!

- Delete Device
  - Will send a message to the backend to remove this device

> [!WARNING]
> This action will remove a selected device and all its related states from ioBroker!

> [!NOTE]
> After a device has been added, a message will be indicated if successfully or error, 
> you can refresh the table to show current devices and their connection status

![DevicesError](admin/img/connectionIssue.png)
![DevicesOK](admin/img/connectionOK.png)

If connection was successfully, the Device will be initiated and all related states created to control their attributes.  
When making any changes to your YAML configuration, reboot of the ESP will disconnect and initiate a new connection.  
During this process, states not part anymore of YAML configuration will be automatically removed.

## Tasmota / ESPEasy migration

Migrating from previous Sonoff Tasmota or ESPEasy setups is very easy. You just need to have ESPHome create a binary for you and then upload that in the web interface.  
See for more details on our [Docu Page](https://DrozmotiX.github.io/languages/en/Adapter/ESPHome/06.migration.html)

**_NOTE:_** Generated yaml files are stored at ```/opt/iobroker/iobroker-data/iobroker.esphome.>instance</>device<.yaml
