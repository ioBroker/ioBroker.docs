This adapter parses data received via URL or from a file, by using regular expressions. For each rule being configured in the settings of this adapter, a state will be created under `parser.<instance number>` and filled and updated with the parsed information.

## Settings

### 1. Default poll interval
This default poll interval value will be used, if no individual poll interval value is specified for an entry in the configuration table (column: "Interval"). The interval is in milliseconds and defines how often the link or file is being read and the states are being updated.

**Note:** 
Do not use a too aggressive poll interval especially for website URLs. For example, if you want to retrieve the price of your shares from a certain website, you probably should be good with an interval of just every 24 hours (= 86400000 ms), if you are not a day trader. If you try to retrieve data from certain URLs too often, the website may ban you and put you on a server blacklist. So please use the poll interval with care.

### 2. Table
Click the "Plus" button to add a new entry to the table.

**Performance Note:**
If you enter the same URL or filename more than once into different table rows, and if the values of the column "Interval" are the same, the content of the URL or filename will be retrieved only **once** and cached for proccesing multiple table rows matching URL/filename and Interval. This allows you to apply multiple regex (so multiple table rows) to a single URL or filename, without the need of retrieving the data multiple times from the source.

**Table fields:**

- ***Name*** - name of state that is being created under `parser.<instance number>`. Spaces are not allowed. You can use dots "." as separator to create sub folders. Example: `Shares.Microsoft.Current` will result in `parser.<instance number>.Shares.Micosoft.Current`.
- ***URL or file name*** - either an URL of a website or the path to a file of which we want to retrieve information. Examples `https://darksky.net/forecast/48.1371,11.5754/si24/de` (weather information Munich), or `/opt/iobroker/test/testdata.txt` (file from within ioBroker).
- ***RegEx*** - regular expression, how to extract data from link. There is a good service to test regula expressions: [regex101](https://regex101.com/). E.g. *temp swip">(-?\d+)˚<* for the line above.
- ***Item*** (German: "Num") - a regex can find (match) multiple entries. With this option you can define which match to be chosen. 0 = first match, 1 = second match, 2 = third match, etc. Default is 0 (first match).
- ***Role*** - one of the roles:
    - custom - user defines itself via *admin" the role
    - temperature - the value is temperature
    - value - the value is a number (e.g. dimmer)
    - blinds - the value is a blind position
    - switch - the value is switch position (true/false)
    - button - the value is a button
    - indicator - boolean indicator
- ***Type*** - the type of variable per the pull-down menu.
- ***Unit*** - Optional: unit of the value added to the state entry. E.g. `°C`, `€`, `GB`, etc.
- ***Old***  - If activated, the state will *not* be updated if the value cannot be read or found in the provided date (URL or file), so it will keep the former value in this case.
- ***Subs*** - Optional: substitute URL or file name. This substitute URL/filename will be used if the URL/file name of the first column is not available.
- ***Factor/Offset*** (for "Type" numbers only) - allows to modify the retrieved data prior to set into the state: 
*calculated value* = *extracted value* * factor + offset , to make immediately modifications of value
- ***Interval*** - poll interval in ms (milliseconds). If blank or 0, the default poll interval will be used. Please see further information above.

*Note:* While applying regex to the retrieved URL/file data, all line breaks will be replaced with spaces to allow multi-line search.



## About Regular expressions (RegExp)
Regular expressions are a powerful tool to parse and extract certain data from strings, and even more important: it allows to extract certain values/text from a given string (like from the HTML of a webpage, or text from a file) by applying rules.

For boolean types, the regex is rather simple. For numeric types, you should mark the number with brackets - "()". E.g. to extract the number from *The temperature is 5°C* you should use " (\d+)" expression.

### Examples
- *.at* matches any three-character string ending with "at", including "hat", "cat", and "bat".
- *[hc]at* matches "hat" and "cat".
- *[^b]at* matches all strings matched by .at except "bat".
- *[^hc]at* matches all strings matched by .at other than "hat" and "cat".
- *^[hc]at* matches "hat" and "cat", but only at the beginning of the string or line.
- *[hc]at$* matches "hat" and "cat", but only at the end of the string or line.
- *\[.\]* matches any single character surrounded by "[" and "]" since the brackets are escaped, for example: "[a]" and "[b]".
- *s.\** matches s followed by zero or more characters, for example: "s" and "saw" and "seed".
- *[hc]+at* matches "hat", "cat", "hhat", "chat", "hcat", "cchchat", and so on, but not "at".
- *[hc]?at* matches "hat", "cat", and "at".
- *[hc]\*at* matches "hat", "cat", "hhat", "chat", "hcat", "cchchat", "at", and so on.
- *cat|dog* matches "cat" or "dog".
- *(\d+)* - get the number from string
- *now (\w+)* later - get the word between "now" and "later"

### Other useful expressions

- (-?\d+) get number (both negative and positive numbers)

## Quality codes

Values can have quality codes:
- 0 - OK
- 0x82 - The URL or file cannot be read.
- 0x44 - Number or string value not found in the text
