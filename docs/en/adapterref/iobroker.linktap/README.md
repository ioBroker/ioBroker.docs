## ioBroker.linktap

Control your garden irrigation with the LinkTap Wireless Water Timer
Manufacturer: https://www.link-tap.com/

## Installation
Was developed under Node.js 12. So it is recommended to use this version at least.

## Settings
Create Api key at https://www.link-tap.com/#!/api-for-developers with your LinkTap credentials. 

Please enter the username and API key in the configuration.
All connected gateways and taplinkers will be retrieved after the adapter is started. The manufacturer allows a polling of all gateway and devices every 5 minutes. The adapter performs the retrieval automatically every hour or each time the adapter is restarted.

The watering status retrieval can be set individually in the configuration based on minutes. It may take up to one minute for LinkTap's web service to provide updated watering information.

All irrigation functions provided by the API have been implemented. 

Important: The desired schedules must be set up in the app prior to use. These can then be enabled / disabled via the adapter. For this purpose the corresponding states of the role "Argument in" must be set additionally.
