## ProCon.IP pool control adapter for ioBroker
ioBroker adapter for basic support of the ProCon.IP swimming pool control
unit. It is intended for integration with your ioBroker home automation, eg.
to build logic that involves other devices or simply to be paired with your
favorit voice assistant(s):
* You can use the [_cloud_](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.cloud) or
  [_IoT_](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.iot) adapter for Alexa
  (and also Google Home, I think) and
* [_yahka_](https://github.com/jensweigele/ioBroker.yahka) as bridge to the
  Apple HomeKit to be reached by Siri or
* use the [_javascript_](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.javascript) to
  build your own custom logic.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/ylabonte/ioBroker.procon-ip/wiki) for more
information.


### What is the ProCon.IP pool control?
![Picture from pooldigital.de](https://www.pooldigital.de/shop/media/image/66/47/a5/ProConIP1_720x600.png)

The ProCon.IP pool control is a low budget network attached control unit for
home swimming pools. With its software switched relays, it can control
multiple pumps (for the pool filter and different dosage aspects) either
simply planned per time schedule or depending on a reading/value from one of
its many input channels for measurements (eg. i/o flow sensors, Dallas 1-Wire
termometers, redox and pH electrodes). At least there is also the option to
switch these relays on demand, which makes them also applicable for switching
lights (or anything else you want) on/off.
Not all of its functionality is reachable via API. In fact there is one
documented API for reading (polling) values as CSV (`/GetState.csv`). In my
memories there was another one for switching the relays on/off and on with
timer. But I cannot find the second one anymore. So not even pretty, but
functional: The ProCon.IP has two native web interfaces, which can be
analyzed, to some kind of reverse engineer a given functionality (like
switching the relays).

For more information see the following link (sorry it's only in german;
haven't found an english documentation/information so far):
* [pooldigital.de webshop](https://www.pooldigital.de/shop/poolsteuerungen/procon.ip/35/procon.ip-webbasierte-poolsteuerung-/-dosieranlage)
* [pooldigital.de forum](http://forum.pooldigital.de/)

**Just to be clear: I have nothing to do with the development, sellings,
marketing or support of the pool control unit. I just developed a solution
to integrate such with ioBroker to make my parent's home a bit smarter.**


### Details on the adapter
The adapter uses the `/GetState.csv` API of the ProCon.IP to poll its values
and another - not documented - API, that operates with bitwise commands to
switch the relays. The second one is also used by the original web interfaces
of the ProCon.IP. So there might be future firmware upgrades, that brake
compatibilty with this adapter or at least it functionality of switching the
relays. 

#### Compatiblity
For now the adapter has been tested and developed in combination with the
ProCon.IP firmware **revision 1.7.0.c**.


## Roadmap

### 1.x.x
There is nothing special on the plan. You can create an issue to suggest new
features/functionality...

**What happened to the points that were on the roadmap, but were not
implemented with the 1.0.0 release?**  
Well, the documentation was already improved.   
The tab view thing seems rather interesting to me. If you would appreciate
such a feature, just let me know...  
The absence of automated tests regarding the functionality of the controller
is quite unpleasant, but the focus is now clearly on becoming stable and
writing good and useful tests for all of the existing code will cost a lot
of time (in relation to the use regarding the complexity and target group of
this software project) and might end in further refactoring. So it will be
something for the future, but not anymore relevant for the 1.0.0 release.


## Development and participation
Feel free to contact me, if you wish to participate in development or
documentation of this adapter.

Useful links for the approach will be
* the [TypeScript adapter template](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.template/tree/master/TypeScript)
  I had started from and
* the [guide for adapter developers](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.docs/blob/master/docs/en/dev/adapterdev.md).


## Changelog

### 1.1.0
Minor release:
* Move API library sources into a [separate package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/procon-ip).
* Update `common.name` attributes when the corresponding label changes.
* Update dependencies

### 1.0.2
Minor update (was accidentally released as patch, regarding the version number):
* Fine tune the polling and control requests 
  (add additional adapter settings for this).
* Wait a configurable amount of consecutive errors, before raising the log 
  level to _Warning_ for polling requests.
* Try to send control commands two more times, if an error occurs on the 
  request. 
**All point should reduce issues regarding irregular network disruptions.**

### 1.0.1
Hotfix release:
* Fix Object State updates  
  For some reason the two js objects used to compare the before and after values
  of the GetState.csv calls became the same object (before was referencing the
  new values). That caused the adapter to never update the object states.

### 1.0.0
Official release in ioBroker adapter repository:  
The most exciting change with this release is, that it's available from the
ioBroker adapter repository. Hence you can just install it, without copy/
pasting the github repo url of this adapter!
* Fix all open [milestone issues](https://github.com/ylabonte/ioBroker.procon-ip/milestone/1)
  especially regarding the ones resulted from the [adapter review](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories/pull/756#issuecomment-646988248))
* Add/Extend documentation
  (see [wiki](https://github.com/ylabonte/ioBroker.procon-ip/wiki)).  
  Now it's up to you to extend the wiki or request me using issues to extend
  the wiki or README.md regarding a specific content.

### 0.4.1
Bugfix release:
* Fix write actions to the appropriate states of external relays  
  _This will add auto-recognition on whether the external relays are activated
  or not and therefore decide on how to handle write actions to the
  corresponding relay state._

### 0.4.0
Public release version:
* Add encryption for configuration settings stored in ioBroker's internal db
* Improve http request/connection error handling
* Reduce logging output
* Remove the unused admin tab

### 0.3.1

* Update dependencies including some reported as vulnerable
* Add connection status indication for iobroker's instance tab
* Add form validation for the configuration settings

### 0.2.0

* Update npm dependencies
* Group admin settings input fields in rows

* Fix object attributes regarding the cloud adapter
* Optimization for the cloud adapter
    * Pre-defined `smartName` attributes for active relays and temperature
      sensors
    * Recognize relays with 'light', 'licht' or 'leucht' in its name as
      `smartType` _LIGHT_
