## wireguard adapter for ioBroker
Connect to WireGuard hosts and grab connection information on peers. This adapter is intended to be a monitoring instance for your WireGuard hosts. It supports plain installations and docker as well.

## Prerequisites
* running ssh server on every host to monitor
* The wg executable (wg.exe on Windows) needs to be in the search path
* username and password of a user with the permission to execute the wg command 

## Installation steps
* Check whether your WireGuard host is running an ssh server. If not - install one. If you can open a commandline using putty (or similar) you're running an ssh server.
* make sure the user you like to use for this is able to execute `wg` (same for Windows and Linux). **This user needs admin privileges!**
* To sum up the test: open a remote command line, log in and execute the `wg show` command. If you receive a proper result you're done and can use these data to run the adapter.  
* Do this for every host you like to monitor
* Install the adapter and configure it

## Config options
Since WireGuard internally only uses the public keys to identify peers, but they are pretty inconvenient to read and recognize for humans the translation page was added. Feel free to add public keys and Names to it to get the names integrated into the object tree.

* Main page
  - Name: Just a symbolic name for the host, since it's more convenient and better memorable than it's IP address
  - Host address: IP address of the host. A fqdn or dns name works also. If you're running WireGuard and ioBroker on the same host you can just use `localhost` as IP.
  - Port: Port number of your ssh server. Default: 22
  - User: The user which executes the script on the host (will be stored encrypted)
  - Password: Password for this user (will be stored encrypted)
  - sudo: whether the wg command should be executed using sudo or not (requires valid config of sudoers! -> see [security hints])
  - Docker: Executes a `docker exec`command to reach a wireguard server inside a docker container. Please check if it fits your needs or whether you may switch to a supported container.
  - poll interval: pause between each poll in seconds (will also delay the first run after adapter start)
  - Container: Name of your docker container. Often "wireguard", but may differ especially when running more than one on a single server
* Translation page
    - Public Key: The public key of one of your peers
    - group name: A symbolic name for this peer
* Config files page
  - Name: Must be the same as on the Main page 
  - Interface: Name of the interface stored in this config file (wg0, wg1, ...)
  - config file: fully qualified path and name of the config file for this interface (/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf, ...)

### executed command line depends on checkboxes:
* No checkbox checked: `wg show all dump` will be executed (for root-like users and use of the SetUID-Bit)
* Sudo checkbox is checked: `sudo wg show all dump` will be executed (works with proper sudoers line)
* Docker checkbox is checked: `docker exec -it wireguard /usr/bin/wg show all dump` will be executed
* Sudo and Docker checkboxes are checked: `sudo docker exec -it wireguard /usr/bin/wg show all dump` will be executed

> If you use WireGuard in a docker container, I assume you are familiar enough with both technologies and security concepts to configure your system to execute the shown commands in a way that doesn't ask for any password.  

### Docker 
Basically everything said about regular installations also applies for docker and works the same way.
Except the needed checkboxes to get the proper command executed and the needed sudoers line. If you use WireGuard inside 
a docker container you may need sudoers lines similar to this:
```
<wg-monitoring-user> ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/docker exec -it wireguard /usr/bin/wg show all dump
<wg-monitoring-user> ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/docker exec -it wireguard /usr/bin/wg set * peer * remove
<wg-monitoring-user> ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/docker exec -it wireguard /usr/bin/wg set * peer * allowed-ips *
<wg-monitoring-user> ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/docker exec -it wireguard /usr/bin/wg syncconf * * 
```
This adapter expects the name `wireguard` for your WireGuard container and the `wg` command in `/usr/bin/`inside the container. 
These values currently can't be customized.

## How it works
* info.connection of the adapter is used to indicate that at least one WireGuard interface is online and reported by `wg show all`. If no Wireguard interface is online - nothing is reported. In that case an error gets logged and the adapters' traffic light turns yellow. 
* This adapter opens an ssh shell on every configured host, executes the `wg show all dump` command, drops the shell and parses the result.
* Since every public key is unique, the adapter uses them to translate the public key into user-friendly, readable and recognisable names.
* WireGuard unfortunately doesn't provide the "connected" state by itself. It only provides the last handshake information.
Since handshakes usually occur every 120 seconds - this adapter calculates the connected state that way, that it assumes a peer is connected when the last handshake is received
less than 130 seconds before.

## Security hints
> I highly recommend the use of sudoers under Linux! 

These security hints rely mainly on linux since it's security system is more complex than the windows one. On a Windows server you'll simply need to use an administrative user. 
Since the `wg` command (which is executed to grab the state of WireGuard) requires administrative permissions, think well of what you are doing here and how you configure the user you place in config.
To protect these credentials as well as possible both - username and password - are encrypted.

Basically there are three ways to execute the command:
* use an administrative user (root or similar). This will work but expose your entire server in case the credentials get lost/stolen.
* use of SetUID-Bit: By setting this bit (as far as I understood) each and every user is allowed to execute the flagged file with administrative privileges without needing any password. **This includes hackers**. So setting this bit on the wg command exposes the entire wg-command with all it's power. If you like to do so execute `chmod u+s /usr/bin/wg` as an administrator.  
* use of sudoers: From my perspective, the most secure way is to set up a new simple user with basic privileges and add a simple line to the sudoers file which allows this user to execute the needed command without entering a password - and ONLY THIS command. Please refer to the documentation of your distribution for proper information on editing the sudoers file and using visudo. The screenshot below shows what needs to be added to the file. `wireguard-monitoring-user` is the user of your choice. The rest needs to be exactly like you see.
  ```
  #iobroker.wireguard adapter
  wireguard-monitoring-user ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/wg show all dump
  wireguard-monitoring-user ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/wg set * peer * remove
  wireguard-monitoring-user ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/wg set * peer * allowed-ips *
  wireguard-monitoring-user ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/wg syncconf * * 
  ```
  This setting allows the `<wireguard-monitoring-user>` on `ALL` hosts to execute the `wg show all dump` command from the directory `/usr/bin/` (may need to be changed on your distribution) without needing a password (`NOPASSWD`).
