**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Usage

This adapter communicates with Sonoff devices with Tasmota firmware or ESP devices via MQTT.

Following topics are expected:
- `tele/DeviceNAME/STATE`
- `tele/DeviceNAME/SENSOR`
- `tele/DeviceNAME/INFOx`
- `tele/DeviceNAME/ENERGY`

- `/DeviceNAME/SR04/Distance`

**Note**: The list could be easily extended. Please send `Pull Requests` or *debug data* for unknown states to developer (via issue).

## Auto-creation of objects
In the web config you can determine which MQTT telegrams create the new objects not in default data points:

* `TELE_SENSOR` - creates objects from `tele/xxx/SENSOR` telegrams
* `TELE_STATE` - creates objects from `tele/xxx/STATE` telegrams
* `STAT_RESULT` - creates objects from `stat/xxx/RESULT` telegrams

Usually TELE_SENSOR should be sufficient for most users.

* `Create object tree` creates objects as tree structure

**Warning!** This option will mess up your sonoff object tree! You have to redo all the settings for storage...
Store the object structure as JSON file, so you can recreate your old structure.
Best is to stop the adapter, delete all objects under sonoff and start the adapter again.

## Flags for LED controllers
The mode states will be created only if device has one of the states:

- `Red`, `Green`, `Blue`, `WW`, `CW`, `Color`, `RGB_POWER`, `WW_POWER`, `CW_POWER`, `Hue`, `Saturation`

States:

* `modeLedExor` - exor for white LEDs and color LEDs => if the white LEDs are switched on, color LEDs are switched off and vice versa (default true)
* `modeReadColors` - allow for color read from MQTT (default false)
