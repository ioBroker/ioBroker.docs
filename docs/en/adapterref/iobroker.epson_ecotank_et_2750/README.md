## Credits

This adapter would not have been possible without the great work of @o0Shojo0o (https://github.com/o0Shojo0o), who developed former releases of this adapter.

## How to report issues and feature requests

Ideally, please use GitHub issues for this, with the best method achieved by setting the adapter to Debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Then retrieve the logfile from disk via the  'log' ioBroker subdirectory, **not** from Admin, which will cut lines. 

## Configuration

1. Create a new instance of the adapter
2. Fill the URL/IP and port of the EPSON EcoTank ET-2750
3. Configur ther Synctime (default 10 minutes)
4. Save the settings
