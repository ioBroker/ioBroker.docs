## mytime adapter for ioBroker

This adapter handle Time (eg: countdown,etc.).
The countdown functionality provides datapoints that you can use to manage a
countdown (e.g. in a script). The adapter also includes several widgets
to visualize these countdowns. Time series can be used to create
complex time series at which the data points are triggered.

### Configuration

#### Countdown

In the configuration dialog Tab "Countdown" you can create a new countdown
eg 'test', set timer to 10 seconds and import the following widgets.
Datapoints are pre configured for a countdown named test.

##### Stop behaviour timer

After the countdown gets the signal stop, the countdown resets
to the time set by timer.

##### Stop behaviour zero

After the countdown gets the signal stop, the countdown remains at 0.

#### Timeseries

In the configuration dialog Tab "Timeseries" you can create a
new timeseries with one or more timerules. For each timerule you can
define different parameters
Each timeseries creates a seperate datapoint which is triggered
at the calculated time events.
The time events are calculated in real time. However, the rrule library
used is not yet perfect in all parameter combinations.
This shows that with some combinations the page goes into an endless loop.
The demo page <http://jakubroztocil.github.io/rrule/> can also be used for experiments.
Additional to add a timerule, you can add a timerule to exclude time events,
to add single time events and also to exclude single time events.

### Usage

#### Usage of Timeseries

##### Available Datapoints of a timeserie

After configuration of a new timeserie the adapter creates the following datapoints:

| datapoint | description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| action    | actual state of thie timeserie. possible values are stop,run |
| cmd       | no function atm                                              |

##### Available action states

| action | description                                                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| stop   | no time event is active at the moment                                                         |
| run    | a time event was triggered. after the configured duration time, the datapoint changes to stop |

#### Usage of Countdown

##### Available Datapoints of a countdown

After configuration of a new countdown the adapter creates the following datapoints:

| datapoint | description                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| action    | actual state of thie countdown. possible values are stop,run,pause,end |
| cmd       | datapoint for commands. possible commands are described below          |
| start     | datapoint for the start time in milliseconds                           |
| end       | datapoint for the end time in milliseconds                             |
| timer     | datapoint for the total time set in milliseconds                       |

##### Available action states of a countdown

| action | description                                                                                           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| stop   | the countdown is stopped, start and end time is set to 0                                              |
| run    | the countdown runs. if the countdown reachs the end time. the action switchs to end                   |
| pause  | countdown is in pausemode. the end time was set to the time of the pause                              |

##### Format of the value for setting the countdown timer

you can set the countdown to an unlimited time.
the notation of the value is
[days:[hours:[minutes:[seconds]]]]
days,hours and minutes are optional.
if you want to set the timer to one day you have
to set hours, minutes and second aswell
you dont have to respect the normal value ranges (eg hours 0-24).
You can also set 48 hours.
If you want you can set irregular time notations. the time is summed up seperatly

**Examples:**

| setting   | description                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1:0:0:0   | set/adds/subtracts 1 day to the timer       |
| 2:0:0     | set/adds/subtracts 2 hours to the timer     |
| 3:0       | set/adds/subtracts 3 minutes to the timer   |
| 120       | set/adds/subtracts 120 seconds to the timer |
| 48:0:0    | set/adds/subtracts 48 hours to the timer    |
| 48:75:120 | set/adds/subtracts the timer                |

##### Format of the template to format the countdown output in the widget

The following placeholders are available:

| placeholder | description                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| d           | days without leading zeros                                      |
| dd          | days with leading zeros                                         |
| H           | hours without leading zeros                                     |
| HH          | hours with leading zeros                                        |
| m           | minutes without leading zeros                                   |

| ss          | seconds with leading zeros                                      |
| \           | Escape character if you want to use a placeholder in the output |

**Examples:**

**Tips:**

If you want to adjust the size of the countdown nixieclock,
under css settings in vis you can enter for half size:
Group CSS-Common / transform "scale(0.5)"

**The actual action state (cdstop,cdrun,cdpause,cdend) of the countdown is available as CSS-Class selector:**

```css
#w00000 .timer.cdend {
  color: red;
}
#w00000 .timer.cdrun {
  color: green;
}
```
