## mytime adapter for ioBroker

This adapter handle Time (eg: countdown,etc.).
The countdown functionality provides datapoints that you can use to manage a countdown (e.g. in a script). The adapter also includes several widgets to visualize these countdowns.
Time series can be used to create complex time series at which the data points are triggered.

### Configuration
#### Countdown
In the configuration dialog Tab "Countdown" you can create a new countdown eg 'test', set timer to 10 seconds and import the following widgets. 
Datapoints are pre configured for a countdown named test.

##### Stop behaviour timer
After the countdown gets the signal stop, the countdown resets to the time set by timer.
##### Stop behaviour zero
After the countdown gets the signal stop, the countdown remains at 0.

#### Timeseries
In the configuration dialog Tab "Timeseries" you can create a new timeseries with one or more timerules. For each timerule you can define different parameters
Each timeseries creates a seperate datapoint which is triggered at the calculated time events.
The time events are calculated in real time. However, the rrule library used is not yet perfect in all parameter combinations. 
This shows that with some combinations the page goes into an endless loop. 
The demo page http://jakubroztocil.github.io/rrule/ can also be used for experiments.
Additional to add a timerule, you can add a timerule to exclude time events, to add single time events and also to exclude single time events.

### Usage

#### Timeseries

##### Available Datapoints

After configuration of a new timeserie the adapter creates the following datapoints:

| datapoint | description                                                               |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| action    | actual state of thie timeserie. possible values are stop,run              |
| cmd       | no function atm                                                           |

##### Available action states

| action    | description                                                                                           |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| stop      | no time event is active at the moment                                                                 |
| run       | a time event was triggered. after the configured duration time, the datapoint changes to stop         |


#### Countdown 

##### Available Datapoints

After configuration of a new countdown the adapter creates the following datapoints:

| datapoint | description                                                               |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| action    | actual state of thie countdown. possible values are stop,run,pause,end    |
| cmd       | datapoint for commands. possible commands are described below             |
| start     | datapoint for the start time in milliseconds                              |
| end       | datapoint for the end time in milliseconds                                |
| timer     | datapoint for the total time set in milliseconds                          |

##### Available action states

| run       | the countdown runs. if the countdown reachs the end time. the action switchs to end                   |
| pause     | countdown is in pausemode. the end time was set to the time of the pause                              |
| end       | the countdown is ended. this state you can use as a trigger for further actions (sound, popups, etc.) |                                |

##### Format of the value for setting the countdown timer

you can set the countdown to an unlimited time. 
the notation of the value is
[days:[hours:[minutes:[seconds]]]]
days,hours and minutes are optional.
if you want to set the timer to one day you have to set hours,minutes and second aswell
you dont have to respect the normal value ranges (eg hours 0-24). you can also set 48 hours.
if you want you can set irregular time notations. the time is summed up seperatly

**Examples**

| setting   | description                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1:0:0:0   | set/adds/subtracts 1 day to the timer       |
| 2:0:0     | set/adds/subtracts 2 hours to the timer     |
| 3:0       | set/adds/subtracts 3 minutes to the timer   |
| 120       | set/adds/subtracts 120 seconds to the timer |
| 48:0:0    | set/adds/subtracts 48 hours to the timer    |
| 48:75:120 | set/adds/subtracts the timer                |

##### Format of the template to format the countdown output in the widget

The following placeholders are available:

| placeholder | description                                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
