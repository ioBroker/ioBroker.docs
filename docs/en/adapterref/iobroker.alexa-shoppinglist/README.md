## alexa-shoppingList adapter for ioBroker

Generates the shoppingList from Alexa

You can also use other Lists from alexa. Configure it in Admin.
When you use the new Admin UI, it will be much easier for you.

There is a State to insert new Items. Just write the Text and Enter.
You can delete active and inactive Lists.
You can also move only one Item, to both directions.

I hope you enjoy

The JSON contains now 2 Buttons to move Items or to delete.
For this you have to insert Code in the VIS Editor under Skript, put this in:

```
 /* Alexa Einkaufsliste JSON */

function setOnDblClickCustomShop( myvalue) {
    let id = myvalue.slice(0,myvalue.indexOf(","));
    let val = myvalue.slice(myvalue.indexOf(",")+1, myvalue.length);
    if (val=== "true"){
      vis.setValue(id,true);
      return
    }
    vis.setValue(id,false);
  }
```
