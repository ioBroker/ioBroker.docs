![Build Status](https://action-badges.now.sh/AlCalzone/ioBroker.tradfri)

Monitor Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and record their information. 
Currently, only recording *advertised* service data is supported. You can monitor which services are advertised by using the nRF Connect app (service data UUIDs).
Connecting and reading/writing service chararcteristics will be supported in a future version.

## Installation

This adapter needs additional libraries to compile. See https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble#prerequisites for detailed instructions.
On Raspberry Pi and similar, this should do it: `sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev libcap2-bin`

If the adapter starts but won't connect to your bluetooth hardware, please check the `info.driverState` state in ioBroker. If it is `unauthorized`, you need to give `node` additional permissions. For Linux, this is as simple as
```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```
which requires `libcap2-bin` to be installed.

## Configuration
If you have multiple bluetooth devices on your system, select the one to use from the dropdown.
In the textbox below, enter all UUIDs of the advertised services you want to record (as found in the nRF Connect app).

## Plugin system
The adapter supports extension via plugins. Those define which advertised services should be listened to and how to translate the data. The plugin structure is defined in https://github.com/AlCalzone/ioBroker.ble/blob/master/src/plugins/plugin.ts and an example of a working plugin is defined here https://github.com/AlCalzone/ioBroker.ble/blob/master/src/plugins/_default.ts

If you have any device transmitting specially encoded information via advertisements, feel free to create a PR with a new plugin for that.
