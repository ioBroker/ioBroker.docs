**Detect devices with all known methods.**

This is a special adapter that tries to find all possible devices that can be reachable from the iobroker host.
Just now it can detect via ping, UPnP (serial planned).

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** 
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## If the adapter cannot find IPs ...

The adapter pings the network of the IP of the current host (x.y.z.1..255). Additionally, UPnP and mDNS are used to detect IPs.  
If not all IPs are found then please check that the iobroker user can execute `/bin/ping`. 
You can execute `sudo setcap cap_net_raw+p /bin/ping` to add missing capabilities/permissions.
