## Installation
You can either install the adapter via the ioBroker web interface or on your local machine via npm.

### Browser-based
1. Open your ioBroker web interface in a browser (eg: 192.168.30.70:8081)
2. Click on Tab "Adapters"
3. Type "Denon" in the Filter
4. Click on the three points and then on the "+" symbol of the DENON AVR adapter
![Add Adapter](/docs/en/media/plusAddAdapter.png)

### Local machine
Navigate into your iobroker folder and execute the following command: 
```bash
npm i iobroker.denon
```

## Setup
Additional to the adapter installation you have to make sure that your AVR is correctly configured.

### ioBroker 
1. Open your ioBroker interface in a browser (eg: 192.168.1.33:8081)
2. Navigate to Tab "Adapters"
3. Click on the three points and then on the "+" symbol of the DENON AVR adapter
![Add Adapter](/docs/en/media/plusAddAdapter.png)
4. Now you can see the adapter configuration page --> type in the ip-address of your DENON AVR or click on the search 
icon to find AVRs in your network (via UPnP)
![Adapter Configuration](/docs/en/media/fillInIp.png)
5. If you also want to adjust the request/poll interval, make sure to click on the "Advanced Settings" Tab. 
By decreasing the Poll Interval the adapter will decrease the time between updating the display contents. 
By decreasing the request interval the time between sending commands will be decreased. 
The default settings should fit well for the most users.
![Advanced Settings](/docs/en/media/advancedSettings.png) 
6. Click on Save & Close

### Network Setup of AV Receiver

1. Press SETUP button, then Menu appears on FL-display(and GUI)
2. Select "Network" --> "Settings"
3. Set parameters described below

   *DHCP: "ON" (Use this setting when DHCP server is on the local network.)*
  
   *IP Address: When <DHCP> sets "Off”, please set IP address.*
  
   *Subnet Mask: When <DHCP> sets "Off", please set Subnet Mask.*
  
   *Gateway: Set the address of Gateway when Gateway is on the local network.*
  
   *Primary DNS: Do not set this parameter.*
  
   *Second DNS: Do not set this parameter.*
  
   *Proxy: Set this parameter "Off".*
  
4. Press SETUP button, then Menu appears on FL-display (and GUI)
5. Select “Network" --> Network Control/IP Control"
6. Set this parameter to "Always On".

## Usage
Take note, that the AVRs can only manage a single telnet connection. If you are having an active telnet connection e. g. with the javascript adapter, the AVR will refuse the connection of this adapter.
Here you can find a description of the states and how to use them.

### Other States
Due to the fact that some AVRs like the DENON POA-3012CI use another logic there are some differences in the states.
The states which are equal to the ones listed above are: settings.powerSystem, settings.expertCommand, display.brightness
and info.connection. Additional the following states are created for each zone 2-12 (even):

* zoneX.speakerOneVolume / zoneX.speakerTwoVolume

    |Data type|Permission|
    |:---:|:---:|
    |number|R/W|
    
    *Number value, which represents the volume of the AVR's speaker. If operationMode is set to 'BRIDGED'

    |Data type|Permission|
    |:---:|:---:|
    |string|R/W|
    
    *Key value pair, which represents the selected input of the AVR's speaker. If operationMode is set to 'BRIDGED' 
    the speakers cannot independently controlled and the control of one also controls the other ones input.*
    
    *The following values are possible:*
    
    *'0': 'BUS L'*
    
    *'1': 'BUS R'*

    |:---:|:---:|
    |string|R/W|
    
    *Key value pair, which represents the operationMode of the AVR. If operationMode is set to 'BRIDGED' 
    the speakers cannot independently controlled and controlling speaker one also controls speaker two.*

    *'0': 'NORMAL'*
        
    *'1': 'BRIDGED'*

    *Boolean value which indicates and controls the audio signal input of your AVR.*  
   
## Missing functions & bugs
If you are missing any functions or detected a bug, please open an [issue](https://github.com/foxriver76/ioBroker.denon/issues).

The adapter is tested with an DENON AVR-X1200W and a Marantz SR5009.
