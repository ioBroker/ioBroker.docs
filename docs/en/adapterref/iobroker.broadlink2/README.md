## Adapter for different Broadlink compatible WLan-devices (RM++,SP++,A1, Floureon, S1C)

This is an ioBroker adapter for multiple  Broadlink switch like RM2, RM3, RM Plus, SP1, SP2, SP3, Honeywell SP2, SPMini, SPMini2, SPMiniPlus and some OEM products from them.
ALso remote controllers are supported like RM2, RM Mini, RM Pro Phicomm, RM2 Home Plus, RM2 Home Plus GDT, RM2 Pro Plus, RM2 Pro Plus2 and RM2 Pro Plus BL. Multiple controllers will generate their own entries and need to be trained separately.
It scans the network to find compatible devices and installs them (currently only switches type SP?).

If you learned states for RM* and then rename their name the state-ID will change to the new name as well!

You can create also your own new commands in LearnedStates if you use 'code'+ your code as the value (with 'CODE_' preceeding the code or even better (because of it will remain if you rename the state) add a field 'code' to native with the admin.object pencil and put there the hex code (without 'CODE_'!).

The adapter has fixed states to send codes from RM-devices or to learn them It can also send individual scenes (actions on multiple devices).

If devices which are configured on a certain IP are not found again they will be flagged 'notReachable'! If they are connected again they will be useable normally.

If a device is not answering for 5 minutes in a row it's set to unreachable. ***notReachable*** devices will give a log warning message every x scans. After some scans the adapter will try to find them again on the same mac address before.

Please delete old devices from admin.objects in case you remove them permanentely or renamed them in your router!

### Note

SP1 devices cannot be polled.

## Configuration

* Enter prefix of network address in configuration which should be removed when generating device names
* Enter the number of seconds between polls. On each poll all SP* devices expluding SP1 are asked what the switch status is. This feature can be disabled by setting the poll delay to 0. On some RM devices with temperature readout the temperature will be updated as well.

## How-To learn codes

* In Objects of ioBroker you can find "broadlink2.[devicename].Learn or LearnRF for '+' type of devices".
* For RM(x)+ (Plus) devices you get also a special RS-sweep-lear button which can learn more devices than on normal 433MHz.
* Set this object to true. (you can click on the button in object view)
* Now press some button on your remote control within 30 seconds. in normal mode press them shortly with some time in between until learned.
* in RF-sweep learn you need to press the button first for ~10 seconds, then release it and then press it aggain for short time.
* An new Object should now appear within the Object "broadlink.[n].[devicename].LearnedState" with the name ">>> Rename learned @ YYYYMMDDTHHmmSS"
* You can click on the button in object view to send the code.
* To rename the item click on the name (starting with `_Rename_learned_`) and change the name. It should not include `,`, `.` or `;` as well as some other characters, they will be replaced by '_';

It is also possible to use the codes from [RM-Bridge](http://rm-bridge.fun2code.de/).
Just create an object (state, type button) with value where you prepend "CODE_" or with native entry `code` without any 'CODE_'.

## Use scenes

* Scenes can contain ID's or names as well as numbers separated by `,`. Normally the ID's will be executed/sent with 100ms time difference but if you need a longer pause between then you can write in a number which reflects the milli seconds to wait. For example `SP:dose=1, 1000, RM:your.L.StereoEin, 1000, RM:your.L.TVEin` would switch on an wireless plug named 'SP:dose', then wait one second (actually 1.1 seconds), Switch on the stero and after another second the tv. You can also switch devices of other adapters, like `hm-rpc.0.MEQ1435726.1.STATE=true` would switch this Homematic device on! Boolsche states can be switched with '=1/=on/=true/=ein', if you leave it without `=` than it will use true. To switch off a device you end it with '=0/=false/=aus/=off' which is necessary to be switched off!

## Use states

* You may create also states for your devices which combines an On and Off commands to a single state which can be switched like any other device..
* You need to list the commands for switching a state on and off in the separate columns, these can be multiple ones so state knows when your device is switched on/off by any of them
* If you set the state the to on or off onlöy the first on/off command will be sent
* If only on commands are present the switch will send the respective command on a numeric value-1, with means it will send the first command if it receives an `0`, the second if it receives a `1`. In this way you can simulate multiple states within one state.
* If you use only '+' as off command then you need to provide 10 on commands separated by ',' which reflect the numbers `0-9` on the remote control. You can send the sstate then a number, like `123`  (max is 9999) and it would send `1`, `2` and `3` with 1/3rd of a second delay between them! In this way you sen set for example the channel on TV to '33' by just write 'TVchannel=33' if the state name is TVchannel.

## Use send messages to adapter

The adapter understands also 'sendTo' commands.

* `debug`: `sendTo('broadlink2.0','debug','on')` (also 0,1,on,off,ein,aus,true,false) would switch debug mode on.
* `get`:  `sendTo('broadlink2.0','get', 'RM2:RMPROPLUS.Temperature'` could request data from device like  `{ val: 29.9, ack: true, ts: 1505839335870, q: 0, from: 'system.adapter.broadlink2.0', lc: 1505839335870 }` zurück
* `switch`: can switch a plug on or off: `sendTo('broadlink2.0','switch','SP:your device id=on')`
* `switch_on`/`switch_off`:  sendTo('broadlink2.0','switch_on','SP:your device id')`
* `send`: `sendTo('broadlink2.0','send','RM:yourdev._Learn')` would start learn and `sendTo('broadlink2.0','send','RM:yourdev.L.yourid')` would send the code.
* `send_scene`: `sendTo('broadlink2.0','send_scene','scene xxx ')` würde den als message angegebenen Text als Szene ausführen
* `send_code`: `sendTo('broadlink2.0','send_code','RM:your remote.CODE_xxxxx')` würde den CODE_xxxx vom R:your name senden.

## Floureon or Beok313 Thermostats

* Most data can be set, the time can be set by writing anything to `_setTime` in which case the time of the device will be set to ioBroker system time. This will be done automatically also on adpter start.

## Config additional dnew devices

* You may add new devices which use same protocol by adding them with the device-ID (in hex or decimal) and the device class (löisted there (class = A1,MP1,RM,RMP,S1C,SP1,SP2,SP3P,T1). So you can add a new remote which the adapter finds only as unknown device with hex ID of 0x1234 to the RM list by 0x01234=RMP. 

## Rename devices

* Devices receive normally their network host name, or a combination of the device type, ID and mac address as their name with the first 2 letters of the type with ':' in front. You can rename such a device with `T1:BroadLink-OEM-T1-fa-83-7c=Beok313` in which case the original name will not be used but the new name used will be `Beok313`.

## Debug mode

* If you add an `!` at the end of the list of added new devices (even if it is empty) you can set the adapter to debug mode where it will log a lot of additional information even iof it is not set to 'info' mode in Admin.

## Known-Issues

* If you learn the same signal multiple times the code can be different everytime. This can not be changed.
* Sometimes it does not find devices if they do not respond to the search. Do a rescan or restart adapter to restart a new instance.

## Important/Wichtig

* Requires node >=V6
