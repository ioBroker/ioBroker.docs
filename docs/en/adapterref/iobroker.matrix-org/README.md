## matrix-org adapter for ioBroker

Adapter for matrix push messages
Big thanks for creating matrix (https://matrix.org/) for creating a full free communication base

### Configuration

Best: Run your own client on your server!

Create an own user as your BOT with password. Create a room for all members who want the bot messages. Add your BOT to this room (not needed if autojoin is active). Add all members to this room. Put all the data into the config. (BOT name, password, room name)

### Usage

Add as many instances as you need. Add a value to matrix-org.0.sendMessage on the way you like, with js
If you set "image" to matrix.0.sendMessage, it will send the matrix logo to your channel.
Or in js use: 
```
sendTo("matrix-org.0", "Hello World!");
```
Or use the blockly symbol in Sendto.

For images from local file system (Linux): 
```
sendTo("matrix-org.0",{file: "file:///tmp/images/test.png"});
```
For images from local file system (Windows):
``` 
sendTo("matrix-org.0",{file: "file:///C:/tmp/images/test.png"});
```
For images as reference: 
```
sendTo("matrix-org.0",{file: "https://www.abcd/images/test.png"});
```
For images in base64: 
```
sendTo("matrix-org.0",{file:{type:"image/png",base64:"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACAAAAAgCAYAAABzenr0AAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAACmSURBVFhH7ZdhCoAgDEZnd9D737T8xJkNNY1Ef+yB2LTcC1qWOT20kCBgjIkh0WwfmeuIxyGYnRzIPElgFSqgAvsKOOdCzeZ1y7EcZzDG16HvwtckihLdA4xxk3HeGGttc17Cc+lN6Ds/dlO6w6/ItQHn7H4GcDK3Em/zNboE5KKjcQstQxVQARVYLlDdC2YzvBfMQgVUYB8BlMWfn2E1ZJ7Fv+dEF0UZoNhXp9NnAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"}});
```
Or
```
sendTo("matrix-org.0",{file:"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACAAAAAgCAYAAABzenr0AAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAACmSURBVFhH7ZdhCoAgDEZnd9D737T8xJkNNY1Ef+yB2LTcC1qWOT20kCBgjIkh0WwfmeuIxyGYnRzIPElgFSqgAvsKOOdCzeZ1y7EcZzDG16HvwtckihLdA4xxk3HeGGttc17Cc+lN6Ds/dlO6w6/ItQHn7H4GcDK3Em/zNboE5KKjcQstQxVQARVYLlDdC2YzvBfMQgVUYB8BlMWfn2E1ZJ7Fv+dEF0UZoNhXp9NnAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"});
```
For html please follow this spec: https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#mroommessage-msgtypes
E.g.: 
```
sendTo("matrix-org.0",{html: "<h1>Hello World!</h1>", text: "Hello World!"});
```
or 
```
sendTo("matrix-org.0",{html: "<table><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>a</td><td>b</td></tr><table>", text: "Your client can not show html!"});
```
If your client is not able to decode html you will get the text.
If your client do not support table it either show the text or simply 12ab.

### to test your configuration use sendMessage

simply open the objects and change the string of one matrix-org instance
Mostly the port is 443, if you have a public system like matrix.org
The port is sometimes 8448, when you have a self hosted system without proxy, but then you know it.

If you like to test it:
Server: matrix.org Port: 443
room: #test-ioBroker-adapter:matrix.org
Join this room and try it out with your own credentials
