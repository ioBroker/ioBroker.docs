## swiss-weather-api adapter for ioBroker

Connects to the great SRG-SSR weather API (https://developer.srgssr.ch/apis/srgssr-weather).  
Weather-Icons are reused from https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/

The SRG-SSR Weather REST API allows you to get weather forecasts and reports from more than 25.000 locations across Switzerland.

**Be aware that this adapter only supports locations within Switzerland.**

### Getting started
1. Get a free accout on https://developer.srgssr.ch/
1. Go to "My Apps" and create a new App. This will create a specific ConsumerKey and ConsumerSecret
1. Find out Longitude / Latitude (decimal degrees) of the chosen location for which forecast is needed
1. Install this Adapter on ioBroker => This can take several minutes (~7min on a Raspberry Pi 3)
1. On Adapter Configuration fill in
   1. ConsumerKey of App
   1. ConsumerSecret of App
   1. Longitude / Latitude of the chosen swiss location for which forecast is needed. => Please use decimal degrees (for example ZÃ¼rich: 47.36667 / 8.5)

This is a scheduled Adapter. It is scheduled every 30 minutes and reads the forecast API of SRG-SSR. You could change this intervall in instance-view (Schedule). A lower intervall is not recomented, since the minimal forecast is 1 hour. 
**So please keep in mind that, after installation, it will take 30 minutes until the forecast data is delivered the frist time and the data-objects in data view are created.** 

On first installation you might want to check if everything works fine and don't want to wait for 30min. In this case you can change the scheduler to 1min. => If everything is working properly, **please change it back to 30min**.
