## KNMI-Weather data and alarms for ioBroker

KNMI provides an API which data is updated every 10 minutes based on all sensor data the institute collects.
This adapter allows to read this API (registration required !) and store all relevant values in user friendly states to be further processed in notifications (Example : Telegram / Pushover) or visialisations.

The API can be used for free up to 300 times a day, therefore the adapter is scheduled every 5 minutes.

Following data is available :

* Weather alarms
* Current climate conditions
* Forecast today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow
* Maps of current Rain-Radar provided by "[Buienradar](https://www.buienradar.nl)"

Location data is related to GPS coordinates stored in admin configuration.
