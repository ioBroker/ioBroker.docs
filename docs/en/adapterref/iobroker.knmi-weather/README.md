KNMI provides an API which data is updated every 10 minutes based on all sensor data the instituate collects.
This adapter allows to read this API (registration required !) and store all relevant values in user friendly states to be further processed in notifications (Example : Telegram / Pushover) or visialisations.

The API can be used for free up to 300 attements a day, therefore the adapter is sheduled every 5 minutes.

Following data is availaible :

* Current klimat conditions

Location data is based on GPS coordinates stored in admin configuration.
