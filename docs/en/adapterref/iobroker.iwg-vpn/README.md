## iwg-vpn adapter for ioBroker

THE adapter for setting up a secure connection from remote devices to the ioBroker and local network leveraging the [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) VPN and controlling local devices via Alexa.

For detailed VPN setup description please refer to the adapter configuration screen or follow the
link: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/iwg-vpn/iobroker.iwg-vpn/blob/main/howto/read-me.html.

Once the VPN is set up, it can be used as a communication channel for controlling local devices via Alexa voice assistant. The already existing device configuration (i.e. ioBroker.iot devices) is just taken, no changes on existing configuration needed.
