## Meater adapter for ioBroker

This adapter brings your MEATER Wireless Meat Thermometer into ioBroker.

It fetches the data from your probe via MEATER cloud API. You can configure 2 intervalls:

1. Update interval when all probes are idle (not cooking)
2. Update interval when minimum 1 cooking session is startet

## Prerequisites

You need to set up a MEATER cloud account (use the smartphone app) and activate MEATER Link.

## Configuration

-   `Username for MEATER cloud`: your registered e-mail adress
-   `Password for MEATER cloud`: the password you used for cloud access
-   `Language`: Some (not all!) values will be translated, e.g. the name of meat
-   `Update interval idle`: time in seconds how often data from cloud should be fetched
-   `Update interval cook`: time is seconds how often data from cloud should be fetched when a cook senssion is active
-   `Temperature unit`: Used to create unit in ioBroker states. Set this to the same unit as you are using in the app. If unit is changed after creating states, delete all probe states and restart adapter
-   `Clear old values`: the MEATER cloud API just sends values for active probes/running cooking sessions. If a session has ended you don't get updates of temperature and status. Activate this checkbox to clear old values which got no update to avoid misunderstandigs.

## Use the adapter

After set-up the adapter it will login automatically into MEATER cloud and fetch its data.

If you don't see any probe and/or values start a cooking session and wait for a moment. You may have to heat the probe to get any values (hot water works fine for testing).
