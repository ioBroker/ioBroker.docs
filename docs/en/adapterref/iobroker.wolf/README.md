## Areas of application: heating / solar / domestic ventilation
The adapter can evaluate a maximum of 4 of the following heaters via the ISM8i:
   * Gas condensing unit: CGB-2 (includes: CGW-2, CGS-2, CSZ-2), MGK-2
   * Oil condensing boiler: TOB
   * Split heat pump: BWL-1-S
   * Living room ventilation CWL Excellent
   A system control module BM-2 or display module AM is always required.
   Furthermore, additional components such as mixer module MM, cascade module KM, solar module SM1 or SM2, may be present in the eBus system.
   
Maximum number of individual modules:
   * Max. 4 heaters hg (1) -hg (4)
   * Max. 3 mixers mm (1) - mm (3)
   * Max. 4 operator panels (BM-2) bm (1) -bm (4)
   * Max. 1 cascade module km (1)
   * Max. 1 solar module (SM1 or SM2) sm (1)
   * Max. 1 Split air/water heatpump (BWL-1-S) hg (0)
   A residential ventilation unit of the CWL Excellent series can also be evaluated and operated with the ISM8i.
