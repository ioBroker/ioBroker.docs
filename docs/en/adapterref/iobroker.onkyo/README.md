**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

### 2.0 Major update!
Starting with 2.0 there are structure changes!   
If you update to this version, you have to change the variables in any other adapter like VIS or javascript!   
The new version supports Materials and cover arts. The media objects supports player widgets like sonos or winamp.

This adapter allows control of Onkyo and Pioneer AVRs using the EISCP protocol.

It uses node-eiscp: https://github.com/tillbaks/node-eiscp

For sending commands, there is a special state "RAW". Writes to that state
trigger only RAW commands like the known EISCP Excel files
As example of an EISCP RAW command in the form of "PWR01".

Another special state maintained by the adapter is "connected". It's a boolean
showing whether node-eiscp is currently connected to a receiver.
