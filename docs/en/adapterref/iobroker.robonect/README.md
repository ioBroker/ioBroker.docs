This is an ioBroker adapter for your Robonect HX enabled lawn mower.

* It has been tested with Robonect v1.1b (with ZeroConf v1.4) and a Gardena R70Li.
* And it has also been tested with Robonect v1.3b (with ZeroConf v1.9) and a Gardena R40Li.

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Settings

* It is required to enter the IP address (like 192.168.x.x) or hostname (like robonect-D247BF) or fully qualified domainname (like robonect-D247BF.fritz.box) of the Robonect module. In case username and password are set, they are required, too.
* ioBroker.robonect polls data at different intervals: By default status information is polled every 60 seconds (1 minute) and other information is polled every 900 seconds (15 minutes).
* It is possible to configure two rest periods to prevent polling e.g. at noon and during the night. Information that can be polled without waking the lawn mower (and make it beep) will still be polled.
* For every API request it is possible to choose the polling interval (status or info) or don't poll at all.
* push service: when activated select the IP address and port the adapter should listen to.

### Password for Robonect

Versions older than v1.3.0 required a simple password - only containing lower- and uppercase letters as well as numbers.
Starting with v1.3.0 strong passwords became possible due to the implementation of HTTP basic authentication. 

### Push service

The robonect module has a config option called "Push Service" - it pushes status information depending on some configurable events.
When activated the adapter will receive push notifications if one of the events happens. With this option activated you may use much longer poll intervalls than the defaults (eg. 6-12h for status and 24h for info).
These data must also be configured in the Robonect module. Even if listening to all IP addresses (0.0.0.0) you need to configure the real IP address in robonect. The IP format to use is like 192.168.x.x:Port

* You can select GET or POST in Robonect - it works both and does exactly the same.
* No username or password are required.

Since only a subset of status information is pushed (WLAN-Signal, Status, Stopped, Mode, duration, hours, distance and battery) pulling is still needed e.g. to get the blade status.

### The Push-Service config should look like this

## Control

### Mode

The mode of the lawn mower can be controlled by changing robonect.0.status.mode. Possible modes are "Auto", "Home", "Manual", "End of day" and "Job" (not fully implemented at the moment).

### Extensions

It is possible to control the extensions GPIO 1, GPIO 2, OUT 1 and OUT 2 of the Robonect module. Requirement is that the mode of the extension is configured as "API" via the Robonect Web-UI. If for example LEDs are connected to OUT1, it is possible to switch them on in the night and off in the morning by setting Robonect.0.extension.out1.status to "true" or "false".

## Known Issues:
* To ensure the robonect is reachable - the adapter pings the device first before sending any requests. 
This ping may fail especially if ioBroker is installed in a container.
It's not an issue with the adapter itself, but since it may happen, and it's pretty difficult to find a solution try
executing  `sudo chmod 4755 /bin/ping` in a shell inside the ioBroker container. This solution assumes that there is a 
permission issue between the iobroker user and the ping utility.
