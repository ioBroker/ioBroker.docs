## extron adapter for ioBroker

Extron SIS adapter

Control devices from Extron. 
This Adapter is designed to control some of the Extron Audio Video Products via the 
**S**imple **I**nstruction **S**et Protocol.
The functional scope of the devices is tremendous. Not all of the features make sense
to be supported with the adapter and the interaction with iobroker.

**Be aware:** When the device type is chosen in the adapter configuration it cannot be changed in the future !

There can be multiple instances of different or same types from this adapter in a iobroker installation. For future releases you have to add a valid license to the adapter configuration for each instance.
If you are a non commercial organisation or use it for private use you can get a licence for free. Please contact the author. 

### Supported devices
- 8x2 Presentation Matrix Switcher (DTP2 CrossPoint 82)
- H.264 Streaming Media Player and Decoder (SMD 202)
- Streaming Media Encoder (SME 211)
- 6x4 ProDSP Processor w/AEC and Dante (DMP 64 Plus C AT)
- 12x8 ProDSP Processor w/Dante (DMP 128 Plus AT)
- 12x8 ProDSP Processor w/AEC, VoIP, and Dante (DMP 128 Plus C V AT)
- Dante Audio Matrix Processor with AEC (XMP 240 C AT)

## ToDo
- The device type is checked on begin of the conversation. This fails sometimes. Must be changed to a more reliable mechanism. 
- Make a more granular selection of used in- and outputs to reduce database size at DSP devices
- add more commands and their implementation on the database side
- improve network reconnect machanism
