## Usage
Allows to access defined URLs or local files via one web server.

Specified routes will be available under `http://ip:8082/proxy.0/context/...`. Of course port, protocol, `proxy.0`, can variate depends on settings.

## Configuration
- Extend WEB adapter: For which web instance will active this proxy.
- Route path: Path for proxy. If "/proxy.0", so the routes will be available under `http://webIP:8082/proxy.0/...`
- Error timeout(ms): Minimal interval between retries if the requested resource was unavailable or returned error.
- Use simple proxy: in this case the very simple but robust method will be used. It is not suitable for web sockets or POST request. Use this method if you have some issues with WEB Instance or socket.io communication.  

## Sample settings

|----------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| admin/         | http://localhost:8081                              | access to admin page                               |
| router/        | http://192.168.1.1                                 | access to local router                             |
| cam/           | http://user:pass@192.168.1.123                     | access to webcam (e.g. call http://ip:8082/proxy.0/cam/web/snapshot.jpg) |
| dir/           | /tmp/                                              | access to local directory "/tmp/"                  |
| dir/           | tmp/                                               | access to local directory "/opt/iobroker/tmp"      |
| file.jpg       | /tmp/picture.jpg                                   | access to local file "/tmp/picture.jpg"            |

**Not all devices can be accessed via proxy.** 

Some devices wants to be located in the root `http://ip/` and cannot run under `http://ip/proxy.0/context/`.

You can read more about context [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware#context-matching)

Additionally the user can define the route path for proxy requests.
