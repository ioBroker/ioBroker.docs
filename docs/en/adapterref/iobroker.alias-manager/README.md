## alias-manager adapter for ioBroker

Manages and creates aliases.

## Quick Intro

### Manage aliases

![Screenshot](img/manual_screenshot_1.png)

* (1) Klick on 'MANAGE ALIASES'
* (2) To create a new alias, klick on 'NEW ALIAS' or
* (3) Select an existing alias to edit

![Screenshot](img/manual_screenshot_2b.png)
* (1) You will then find an area with general settings of this alias, like the name or the common role
* (2) Below you will find a list with all the datapoints of the alias
* (3) You can add alias-datapoints to this list either by adding an empty one or by selecting an existing iobroker-datapoint and copy its settings to a new alias-datapoint
* (4) You can delete datapoints by clicking on the garbage-icon
* Every datapoint has several fields to configure it:
    * In the grey area you may set the name or delete the datapoint
    * In the blue area you can configure the role, the type and - optional - the unit
	* In the green area you can set optional min and max, and determine if the datapoint should be readonly (common.write is off) and if its value can be accessed (common.read is on - which will be the right setting for most cases)
	* In the red area you can: 
	    * (5) Configure the original ioBroker-datapoint, this alias-datapoint is linked to. Both (the original datapoint and the alias-datapoint) well be kept in sync.
		* (6) Furthermore you can configure conversion-functions for read and write. 
		    * Example: If you set ``val / 10`` as "Read-Function", the value of the aias-datapoint will always be 10 percent of the original datapoint. 
			* In most cases you would then like to configure ``val * 10`` as "Write-Function", to also keep this ratio, when writing to the alias-datapoint.
		* Please read more about that in the ioBroker-documenation about aliases under https://www.iobroker.net/#en/documentation/dev/aliases.md

* (1) When clicking on 'COPY ALIAS' to copy or
* (2) on 'RENAME ALIAS' to rename the alias, the following dialog field will open:

![Screenshot](img/manual_screenshot_4.png)
\
Here you can:
* (1) Set a new id and
* (2) Set a new common name for the alias
* (3) By clicking on 'ADD REPLACEMENT' you can add lines to the following list, where you can:
    * (4) Enter a string, that will be searched for, and replaced by (5) this string
	* With this funcion, you can quickly change the original ioBroker-datapoints, your alias-datapoints are linked to
	* Example: 
	    * You have a fan with several datapoints like ``SET``, ``ERROR`` and ``UNREACH``
		* These alias-datapoints are linked to original datapoints like ``hm-rpc.0.JEQ0698034.1.STATE``, ``hm-rpc.0.JEQ0698034.0.ERROR`` and ``hm-rpc.0.JEQ0698034.0.UNREACH``
		* Now, if your device is broken and has to be replaced by a new one, its serial number will change, lets say, for example to ASDF1234
		* To update all the links in all you alias-datapoints in one go you can search for ``hm-rpc.0.JEQ0698034`` and replace it by ``hm-rpc.0.ASDF1234``
		* This is also useful, when creating new aliases, that are similar to an old one. Just copy the alias, set a new id and name and use the replacement-function, to adjust the linked datapoints

![Screenshot](img/manual_screenshot_5.png)
* After changing settings, you can:
* (1) Save all changed alias-datapoints in one go by clicking on 'SAVE ALL CHANGES' or
* (2) Save only one datapoint by clicking on 'SAVE CHANGES'
* (3) Finally you can delete the entire Alias by clicking on 'DELETE ALIAS'

### Autocreate Alias

![Screenshot](img/manual_screenshot_6b.png)

* (1) Klick on 'AUTOCREATE ALIASE'

![Screenshot](img/manual_screenshot_7b.png)
* (1) First select an ID of a device from the ioBroker object tree
* (2) Then click on 'TRY TO CREATE ALIAS FROM THIS DEVICE'
* (3) Afterwards you will find the determined settings for the Alias and
* (4) A list of all datapoints of the selected device
    * All automatically recognized datapoints will be checked (only checked lines will be saved)
	* If automatically recognized, the datapoint will have an 'Destination ID' set. This will be the corresponding datapoint of the alias (the original datapoint will be linked to this new alias-datapoint). The autocreate-function tries to match to stanardized datapoint-ids, depending on the type of device that was recognized. However, you can change the settings as you like, but every 'Destination ID' has to be unique.
	* And finally you can enter a name for the destination alias-datapoint
	* All NOT automatically recognized datapoints appear in the list unchecked. You can manually adjust the settings and activate the checkbox.
	* (5) You can also manually add other datapoints to this list or clear the complete list
* (6) You can then save the new alias with all the checked(!) datapoints (unchecked datapoints will be discarded)
* Afterwards you will be automatically transfered to the 'MANAGE ALIASES' tab and the new alias will be opend, to adjust its settings as needed
