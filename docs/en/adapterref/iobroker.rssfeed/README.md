## Overview

Adapter to request and show RSS Feeds of different standards (Atom, RSS, RDF).
You can customize the output of the feed with a template system. In the templates you can include HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Important: Only the english translation is valid due to bugs in automatic translations into other languages made by iobroker

## Installation

Install the adapter as normal from the stable repository. If you want to test new features or bug fixes you can also install the adapter from the beta repository. For Features and news, please see the Test and Support thread for this adapter in the iobroker forum.

After Installation the adapter should then be displayed in the adapter section in the iobroker.
Sometimes it happens that the changes are not visible, especially with web changes (widgets / configuration dialog), the following command may have to be executed on the command line:

```bash
iobroker upload rssfeed
```

In the right area in the line of the adapter, an instance can be added using the plus button

## Configuration

The configuration is easy. There are only a few fields

### RSS Feed Multi widget 3

With this widget, several feeds can be aggregated in one feed.
Due to the multiple feeds, there are a few differences in the data availability in the template compared to the normal RSS feed widget.
The meta variable is not available in the template. However, 3 meta attributes title and description are available in each individual article under the names meta_title and meta_description.
In addition, a general name can be assigned to each feed in the settings, which is available within the template under the name meta_name in each article so that the origin of an article can be identified.
Otherwise, the same rules apply to the template as for the RSS feed widget.

### JSON Template2

Using this widget, any data point with JSON data can be displayed as desired.
The display is done using a template format, which can be thought of as a combined form of HTML code + JavaScript + special tags that control the display of the JSON attributes.

| Setting      | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rss_template | The template can be used to determine the appearance of the JSON data. All valid HTML tags (including CSS attributes in style tags) can be used in the template. There are also special tags within which the JSON data is displayed and JavaScript instructions can be executed. |
| json_oid     | Selection of the data point with the corresponding JSON data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

For details on the template system, see chapter Template based on examples

The JSON data is passed to the template with the prefix data. In addition, the current widgetID is also available as a variable so that it can be specified in individual CSS instructions.

**Advanced use case:**

In the examples above, only the pure output was covered. The template can now also be enriched with HTML tags to achieve a specific layout. Here is an example:

```html
<h3>Output</h3>
<style>
  .mycssclassproperty {
    color: green;
  }
  .mycssclassdata {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
<% for (var prop in data.oneobject) { %>
<div>
  <span class="mycssclassproperty"
    ><%- "data.oneobject." + prop + " = " %></span
  >
  <span class="mycssclassdata"><%- data.oneobject[prop] %></span>
</div>
<% } %>
```

**Result:**

```text
    data.oneobject.attribute1 = 1
    data.oneobject.attribute2 = 2
```

(In Markdown colors arent visible)

## Templatesystem

## Tags

The template system works with certain tags.
The tags used mean the following

| `tag` | description                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <%=   | The content of the contained expression / variable will be escaped. |
| <%-   | The content of the contained expression / variable is unescaped.    |
| <%    | No output, is used for enclosed javascript instructions             |
| %>    | is generally a closing tag to complete one of the previous ones     |

Everything that is outside of these tags is displayed exactly as it is or if it is HTML interpreted as HTML.
Within the template you have 2 predefined variables available

### Example object

For all the following examples the following json is used.

```json
{
  "onearray": ["one", "two"],
  "oneobject": {
    "attribute1": 1,
    "attribute2": 2
  },
  "onenumber": 123,
  "onetext": "onetwothree"
}
```

Attributes could be output as follows

**Template:**

```html
<%- data.onenumber %> <%- data.onetext %>
```

**Result:**

```text
    123 onetwothree
```

Arrays can be accessed via an index. The index always starts with 0. However, there are also fake arrays where the index does not start with 0 or even consists of text. Here the rules for objects apply. In the example above, this would be

**Template:**

```html
<%- data.onearray[0] %> <%- data.onearray[1] %>
```

**Result:**

```text
    one two
```

If you try to output an array directly without an index, the template outputs all elements separated by commas

**Template:**

```html
<%- data.onearray %>
```

**Result:**

```text
    one,two
```

Arrays can also consist of a collection of objects. The example here contains only a simple array. An example of arrays with objects will be given later.

**Template:**

```html
<% for (var i = 0; i < data.onearray.length ; i++ ) { %> <%- data.onearray[i] %>
<% } %>
```

**Result:**

```text
    one two
```

**Objects** can contain individual attributes, arrays or objects again. This means that JSON data can be nested to any depth.

Attributes of an object can be addressed using dot notation or bracket notation. The dot notation only works if the attribute conforms to certain naming conventions (first character must be a letter, rest numbers or letters or underscore).
The bracket notation also works for attributes that do not conform to the naming convention.

**Dot notation:**

**Template:**

```html
<%- data.oneobject.attribute1 %>
```

**Bracket notation:**

**Template:**

```html
<%- data.oneobject["attribute1"] %>
```

**Result for both examples:**

```text
    1
```

Loop over the attributes of an object

**Template:**

```html
<% for (var prop in data.oneobject) { %> <%- "data.oneobject." + prop + " = " +
data.oneobject[prop] %> <% } %>
```

**Result:**

```text
    data.oneobject.attribute1 = 1
    data.oneobject.attribute2 = 2
```

## Available variables in templates

### `rss.meta`

This contains all meta information about the feed. The following content is available. I think the identifiers are self-explanatory. In the help I will describe them in more detail. or specify the content (some are arrays)
Only in Rss Feed widget 2, a complete set of the meta information is available

The usage in the template see in **Template based on example**

- `meta.title`
- `meta.description`
- `meta.link`
- `meta.xmlurl`
- `meta.date`
- `meta.pubdate`
- `meta.author`
- `meta.language`
- `meta.image`
- `meta.favicon`
- `meta.copyright`
- `meta.generator`
- `meta.categories`

### `rss.articles or articles`

Is an array with individual elements (javascript array). Each element has the following properties.
So that it fits, for example, I will do the prefix item in front of it. But if you want you can choose that yourself. It only has to be named accordingly in the loop (forEach). Here, too, the identifiers are self-explanatory. Not all attributes are filled in every feed. The most important ones are already included in the template above.

The articles are available as rss.articles in RSS feed widget 2 and as articles in RSS feed multi widget 3

The usage in the template see in **Template based on example**

- `item.title`
- `item.description`
- `item.summary`
- `item.link`
- `item.origlink`
- `item.permalink`
- `item.date`
- `item.pubdate`
- `item.author`
- `item.guid`
- `item.comments`
- `item.image`
- `item.categories`
- `item.source`
- `item.enclosures`

Brief description of what happens in the individual lines  
Z1: The output of the feed title  
Z2: Without output. Javascript command to loop over all articles, with each turn the current element is assigned to the variable item.  
Z3: Output of date and time is. It is enclosed with a p / small tag for formatting. The vis-own date format function is used for formatting. Description can be found in the adapter vis.  
Z4: The output of the article title. A Header 3 - tag is used for formatting.  
Z5: Output of the content of the article. It is enclosed with a p-tag. Here, at least in the two examples, HTML code is included, which usually comes with an image and descriptive text  
Z6: Output a div tag that clears special formatting in the feed-html (in both examples for tagesschau and bild it is needed. Other feed maybe didn't need it.  
Z7: Without output. This line closed the javascript loop . Everything that was defined between Z2 and Z7 is repeated for every single article.
