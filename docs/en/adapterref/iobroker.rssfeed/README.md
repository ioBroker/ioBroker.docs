## Overview
Adapter to request and show RSS Feeds of different standands (Atom, RSS, RDF).
You can customize the output of the feed with a template system. In the templates you can include HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Installation
The adapter available in the latest repository.

## Add an Instance
After Installation the adapter should then be displayed in the adapter section in the iobroker.
Sometimes it happens that the changes are not visible, especially with web changes (widgets / configuration dialog), the following command may have to be executed on the command line:

```
iobroker upload rssfeed
```

In the right area in the line of the adapter, an instance can be added using the plus button

## Configuration
The configuration is relatively easy. There are only a few fields

| Setting                           | description                                                                                                           |  
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  
| Refresh                           | is the general specification of how often the feed should be called up again in minutes. The default is 60 minutes    |  
| Maximum items in the data point   | The total amount of data to be processed can be limited here.                                                         |  

Then for each new feed:

| Setting                           | description                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name                              | A name for the datapoint. Inside a folder a name must not appear twice.                           |
| Category                          | Name for a subfolder there the datapoint should appear. The category must be unique               |
| Url                               | The full address of the feed (with http: // or https: //, see examples below)                     |
| Refresh                           | A different value can be specified for this feed. Otherwise the general specification is taken    |
| Edit button                       | The selected Item will be removed and the values appear in the Adding section                     |
| Delete button                     | The selected Item will be  removed                                                                |

If you saved and closed the configuration, the feed-data can be found as a JSON data point in the object tree.

## vis and widgets
The following widgets actually exists
* RSS Feed widget -  to show a single feed
* RSS Feed Multi widget -  to show several aggregated feeds in one widget.
* RSS Feed meta Helper - a helper widget to inspect the meta data of a feed 
* RSS Feed article Helper - a helper widget to inspect the article data of a feed 
* RSS Feed marquee - a widget to show the Headlines of a feed as a marquee 
* JSON Template - a wdiget that have nothing todo with RSS Feeds, but you can define a custom template to show any JSON-Data in vis.

Documentation for the vis-widgets are available inside vis or [Widget-Documentation/german](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/oweitman/ioBroker.rssfeed/blob/master/widgets/rssfeed/doc.html)

## Template based on examples
An example that I tested with the following RSS feeds:

* http://www.tagesschau.de/xml/rss2
* https://www.bild.de/rssfeeds/rss3-20745882,feed=alles.bild.html

```
<%= meta.title %> 
<% articles.forEach(function(item){ %>
<p><small><%- vis.formatDate(item.pubdate, "TT.MM.JJJJ SS:mm") %></small></p>
<h3><%- item.title %></h3>
<p><%- item.description %></p>
<div style="clear:both;" />
<% }); %>
```

The template system works with certain tags.
The tags used mean the following

| tag   | description                                                           |  
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |  
| <%=   | The content of the contained expression / variable will be escaped.   |  
| <%-   | The content of the contained expression / variable is unescaped.      |  
| <%    | No output, is used for enclosed javascript instructions               |  
| %>    | is generally a closing tag to complete one of the previous ones       |  

Everything that is outside of these tags is displayed exactly as it is or if it is HTML interpreted as HTML. (see e.g. the p-tag, div-tag, small-tag
Within the template you have 2 predefined variables available

#### meta 
This contains all meta information about the feed. The following content is available. I think the identifiers are self-explanatory. In the help I will describe them in more detail. or specify the content (some are arrays)
meta.title
meta.description
meta.link
meta.xmlurl
meta.date
meta.pubdate
meta.author
meta.language
meta.image
meta.favicon
meta.copyright
meta.generator
meta.categories

#### articles
Is an array with individual elements (javascript array). Each element has the following properties.
So that it fits, for example, I will do the prefix item in front of it. But if you want you can choose that yourself. It only has to be named accordingly in the loop (forEach). Here, too, the identifiers are self-explanatory. Not all attributes are filled in every feed. The most important ones are already included in the template above.

item.title
item.description
item.summary
item.link
item.origlink
item.permalink
item.date
item.pubdate
item.author
item.guid
item.comments
item.image
item.categories
item.source
item.enclosures

## Template example and detailed description
```
<%= meta.title %> 
<% articles.forEach(function(item){ %>
<p><small><%- vis.formatDate(item.pubdate, "TT.MM.JJJJ SS:mm") %></small></p>
<h3><%- item.title %></h3>
<p><%- item.description %></p>
<div style="clear:both;" />
<% }); %>
```

Brief description of what happens in the individual lines  
Z1: The output of the feed title  
Z2: Without output. Javascript command to loop over all articles, with each turn the current element is assigned to the variable item.  
Z3: Output of date and time is. It is enclosed with a p / small tag for formatting. The vis-own date format function is used for formatting. Description can be found in the adapter vis.  
Z4: The output of the article title. A Header 3 - tag is used for formatting.  
Z5: Output of the content of the article. It is  enclosed with a p-tag. Here, at least in the two examples, HTML code is included, which usually comes with an image and descriptive text  
Z6: Output a div tag that clears special formatting in the feed-html (in both examples for tagesschau and bild it is needed. Other feed maybe didnt need it.  
Z7: Without output. This line closed the javascript loop . Everything that was defined between Z2 and Z7 is repeated for every single article.
