**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

Netatmo adapter for ioBroker

## __Important Note for Realtime events (Doorbell, Welcome, Presence, CO2/Smoke-Alarm)__
To receive realtime events from Netatmo you need an iot/Pro-Cloud Account with an Assistent- or Remote-License and an installed iot Instance connected to this account. The iot Instance needs to have v1.14.0 or higher.

Please select the iot Instance in the adapter settings and restart the adapter.

Netatmo adapter versions < 3.0 used an heroku service to pass these webhook events through, but Heroku has deceased this free service. So all Netatmo versions < 3.0 will not get realtime events anymore since 28.11.2022! Because of this we decided for this way to use proofed and stable iot/Pro-Cloud services.

## __Important Note for Authentication changes October 2022__
According to Netatmo the "old" way to authenticate with username and password directly by entering them into the adapter will be disabled by October 2022.

Version 2.0 of the adapter addresses this change and adjust the authentication. All upgrades before October 2022 should allow a seamless upgrade to 2.0.0 on the first start automatically - else requires a new authentication.

## __Important Note for v2.0.0!__
With v 2.0 of the adapter the object structure will change completely! Instead of names we decided to better use the unique IDs to make sure that duplicate or changing names do not produce issues.


## Installation and Configuration
You need to authenticate with your NetAtmo account using the Adapter Admin UI. 

First select all relevant device types you want to sync data for. When you change them you need to do the Authentication again later.

If you want to use a dedicated client-id/secret (see below) you can also enter them before the Authentication.

Use the "Authenticate with Netatmo" Button to start the authentication flow. A new Windows/Tab will be opened with the Netatmo Login page. After logging in and acknowledging the data access you are redirected back to your admin page.

In case of success just close the window and reload the adapter configuration. In case of an error check the error message and try again

By default, a general API key is used to do the requests which limits the update interval to 10 Minutes! 

To increase the interval or to get live updates from Welcome & Presence, CO- und Smoke-Detectors are only you need to enter an own ID/Secret from your NetAtmo App.
To do so, go to the following URL, login with your Netatmo account and fill out the requested form on https://auth.netatmo.com/access/login?next_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdev.netatmo.com%2Fapps%2Fcreateanapp !

Please make sure to configure your limits that they respect https://dev.netatmo.com/guideline#rate-limits (and have in mind that these limits also exist for ALL USERS if you do not use an own ID/Secret)

## Usage
The adapter should query all device types that you enabled in the configuration. If you change this you need to Re-Do the "Authenticate with Netatmo".

The adapter then creates states with data of the devices and extra "event" states for the devices that support this. To receive these events you need to choose the iot Instance and add a pro Cloud Account (see above).

Some devices are initialized with the latest event per type (if it happened in the last time), e.g. the cameras. For other device types (e.g. smoke/co2 sensors) the events are not pre-filled from the past and these states will be filled as soon as the next event is received.

### Special note for iDiamant/Bubendorff Roller shutters
The Netatmo API do not provide real time data for changes to the roller shutter devices. This means that the data are polled defined in the polling interval.
This basically means that the data will not be accurate in real time when the rollershutter are controller directly or via the Netatmo App.

When the devices are controlled via the adapter, it will update the values 2s and 17s after the controlling so that the data could be more up-to-date.

Depending on the device The target position can be set to any number between 0% and 100% OR only to 0% or 100% (and -1 for stop). But for these actions also the convenient buttons open, close and stop can be used.

## sendTo support

### setAway
You can also use the sendTo command to set all persons as away (for example if in use as alarm system)
```
sendTo('netatmo.0', "setAway", {homeId: '1234567890abcdefg'});
```
or
```
sendTo('netatmo.0', "setAway");
```
to mark all persons as away for all cameras

it's also possible to mark one or more specific persons as away
```
sendTo('netatmo.0', "setAway", {homeId: '1234567890abcdefg', personsId: ['123123123123123']});
```

The parameter homeId is the string listed behind the name of your Camera within the Objects tab (optional, if multiple cameras are installed),
the personsId is the id within the "Known" persons folder

### setHome
Basically the same functionality as described for "setAway" above also is existing for "setHome" to set persons or full homes as "occupied".
