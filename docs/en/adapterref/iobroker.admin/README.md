# Admin

The admin adapter is used to configure the whole ioBroker-Installation and all its adapters. 
It provides a web-interface, which can be opened by "http://<IP-Address of the server>:8081" 
in the web browser. This adapter is automatically installed together with ioBroker.

## Configuration
The configuration dialog of the adapter "admin" provides the following settings: 

![img_002](img/admin_img_002.jpg)

**IP:** the IP-address of the "admin" web-server can be chosen here. 
Different IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be selected. The default value is 0.0.0.0. 
If you think, that 0.0.0.0 is invalid setting, please let it stay there, because it 
is absolutely valid. If you change the address, you will be able to reach the web-server 
only through this address. **Port:** You can specify the port of the "admin" web-server. 
If there are more web servers on the PC or device the port must be customized to avoid problems 
of a double port allocation. **Coding:** enable this option if secure https protocol should be used. 

**Authentication:** If you want the authentication with login/password you should enable this check-box. 
Default password for user "admin" is "iobroker" **Buffer:** to speed up the load of the pages enable this option. 
Normally only the developer wants to have this option unchecked.

## Handling
The main page of the admin consist of several tabs. **Adapter:** Here the instances of 
a adapters can be installed or deleted. With the update button 

![img_005](img/admin_img_005.jpg)

on the top left we can get if the new versions of adapters are available. 

![img_001](img/admin_img_001.jpg)

The available and installed versions of the adapter is shown. For overall view the state of the 
adapter is coloured (red=in planning; orange=alpha; yellow=beta). The updates to a newer version of 
the adapter are made here also. If there is a newer version the lettering of the tab will be green. 
If the question mark icon in the last column is active you can get from there to web site with information of the adapter. 
The available adapter are sorted in alphabetical order. Already installed instance are in the upper part of the list. 

**Instance:** The already installed instance are listed here and can be accordingly configured. If the title of the 
instance are underlined you can click on it and the corresponding web site will be opened. 

![img_003](img/admin_img_003.jpg)

**Objects:** the managed objects (for example setup / variables / programs of the connected hardware) 

![img_004](img/admin_img_004.jpg)

**States:** the current states (values of the objects)   
If the adapter history is installed, you can log chosen data points. 
The logged data points are selected on the right and appear with a green logo. 

**Scripts:** this tab is only active if the "javascript" adapter is installed.

**Node-red:** this tab is only visible if the "node-red" adapter installed and enabled.

**Hosts:** the computer which ioBroker is installed on. Here the latest version of js-controller can be installed on. 
If there is a new version the letters of the tab are green. To search for a new version you have to click on the update 
icon on the bottom left corner. 

**Enumeration:** here the favourites, trades and spaces from the CCU are listed. 

**Users:** here the users can be added. To do this click on the (+). By default there is an admin. 

**Groups:** if you click on the (+) on the bottom left you can create user groups. From the pull-down menu the users get assigned to the groups. 

**Event:** A list of the running updates of the conditions. 

**Hosts:**
Information about the computer on which ioBroker is installed. The current version of the js controller can be updated here. If a new version is available, the label of the tab appears in green.

**Log:** here the log is displayed In the tab instance the the logged log level 
of the single instance can be set. In the selection Menu the the displayed minimum log level is selected. If an error occurs the 
lettering of the log appears in red.

**System settings:**
Settings such as language, time and date format and other system-wide settings are made in the menu that opens here.

The repositories and security settings can also be set here.

## Changelog
<!--
    Placeholder for the next version (at the beginning of the line):
    ### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
-->
### 8.0.19 (2026-09-26)
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed: in the credentials of the system settings, a long translation of the type - "Benutzerdefiniert" in German - ran into the ID next to it, because the column had a fixed width that the text did not fit into. The column is wider now, and a translation that is longer still is cut with an ellipsis and shown in full as a tooltip (#3642)
- (@GermanBluefox) Changed: an object of an adapter can only be deleted in the expert mode now - the delete button in the row, the entry in the context menu and the `Delete` key are gone without it. Deleting such an object can stop the adapter from working, and it is created again at its next start anyway. Objects a user creates themselves (`0_userdata.*` and `alias.*`) can still be deleted without the expert mode (#3639)
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed: an object whose ID contains a "/" - e.g. `ocpp.0./TACW1142021G1543.1.meterValues.Power_Active_Import` - could not be opened from the object tree. The ID went into the URL unencoded, so it was read back cut off at its first slash: the dialog showed the wrong title, the history settings started at 1 January 1970, the "Chart" tab disappeared and switching the tab ended in `can't access property "ocpp.0."`. The ID now survives the round trip through the URL (#3634). Needs `@iobroker/gui-components` 10.3.5
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed: in a multihost system, the Log tab asked its own controller whether `getLogs` understands a log level, but sent the request to the selected host. If that host still ran an older js-controller, it answered with the complete log file. The question now goes to the host whose log is shown
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed: if a host knows the command `searchLogs` but cannot carry it out - e.g. because it writes no log file at all - the Log tab showed its error. Its files are now read the way those of an older controller are read
- (@GermanBluefox) The assistant is shown only on admin tabs, not on the config pages of other adapters.

### 8.0.18 (2026-09-23)
- (@krobipd) Fixed: the admin showed its start screen for half a minute when the host could not reach the repository server (no internet, firewall). The start no longer waits for the repository and the installed versions; only the adapters tab needs them, and it fills itself as soon as they arrive
- (@krobipd) Fixed: on a slow or busy host, the admin start ended with "Cannot get hosts: Error: timeout" and an empty menu column until the page was reloaded. The menu and the host selector now try again (after 2 s, 5 s, then every 10 s) and after a reconnect, without an alert for each failed attempt; a missing permission is still reported once
- (@krobipd) Fixed: when the instance objects could not be read, the pinned config manager entries were deleted from the menu
- (@krobipd) Changed: several instance changes in a row rebuild the menu only once, and an older rebuild can no longer overwrite a newer one
- (@GermanBluefox) Changed: in the categories, an object dragged from one room or function onto another one is moved there; it is copied only if Shift, Ctrl or Alt is held while dropping (formerly only Alt, and the object often appeared to be copied anyway). The preview at the pointer shows whether it will be moved or copied, and a hint below the members explains the keys
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed: after an object was moved to another room or function, it was still shown in the old one until the page was reloaded
- (@GermanBluefox) Added: the "Default History" selection in the base settings shows the icons of the history adapters, in the list and in the field
- (@GermanBluefox) Added: the base settings open with the tab that was used last, unless the link names a tab

### 8.0.17 (2026-09-20)
- (@BenAhrdt) Added: a config manager instance can be pinned to the menu. The pin sits in the toolbar of the device list and creates an entry that opens exactly this instance, so an adapter no longer needs an `adminTab` of its own just to lead there. The pinned instances are stored per browser (or in the GUI settings, if they are switched on), and an instance that is deleted or no longer offers a device manager loses its entry
- (@GermanBluefox) Added: a quick filter in the menu. From 11 entries on, a magnifier appears next to the logo; it turns the header into a text field and hides the menu entries that do not match. Both the translated and the English name are searched, so the English name of a tab finds it in every language; Enter opens the first hit, Escape closes the filter
- (@GermanBluefox) Added: the "Used by" column of the credentials now lists the scripts, too. Admin searches the sources of all scripts for `SECRETS.<ID>` (also `SECRETS['<ID>']`) and shows the scripts that read the credential; hovering an entry shows the full script ID. The engine of the script provides the icon, so `script.js.*` and `script.py.*` are treated alike

### 8.0.16 (2026-09-18)
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed: once the order of the menu was saved, the tab of a newly installed adapter always came last and its `common.adminTab.order` had no effect. The tab is now placed after the tab that precedes it by order; the tabs the user has arranged keep their position
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed: admin wrote the system config each time the menu was loaded or an instance changed, even though nothing had changed
- (@GermanBluefox) Added: with HTTPS enabled, admin speaks HTTP/2 - the browser loads the page and all its files over a single connection. Clients without HTTP/2 fall back to HTTP/1.1 automatically; the new option "Use HTTP/2" in the instance settings turns it off
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed: the MCP endpoint built into admin (`/mcp`) always answered with the 404 page, so MCP clients could not connect to it
- (@GermanBluefox) Changed: the "page not found" page has the look of admin 8, follows its light or dark theme and is shown in the language of admin

### 8.0.15 (2026-09-16)
- (@GermanBluefox) Added: the Log tab searches the log files of the selected host - also the rotated and gzipped ones, based on [ioBroker.logsearch](https://github.com/disaster123/ioBroker.logsearch) by @disaster123. Typing in the message field still filters the shown entries; Enter searches the files with all filters of the table. The time column chooses the range - from the latest entries up to 30 days - and new entries keep arriving live. Entries that span several lines, like stack traces, stay together. The files of the own host are read from the disk; another host searches its files itself if its js-controller supports `CONTROLLER_SEARCH_LOGS`, otherwise it sends them with `getLogFile`. A new button exports the shown entries as a text file
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed: the choice "Tips at start" in the system settings showed its two options in English in every language, as the entry was missing the flag that translates the values
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed: the first "Did you know?" tip showed the raw `<img src='...' />` tag as text instead of the expert-mode icon. A tip may contain images now: the `src` is a file or a data URI, `width`, `height` and `alt` are optional, and `class='icon'` draws a monochrome icon in the color of the text, so that it stays visible in the dark themes as well
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed: the system settings closed by themselves right after opening them on the "Objects" or "Files" tab while an object or file was selected. The browser wrote its selection back into the URL and so replaced the dialog there
- (@GermanBluefox) Changed: the country lists in the system settings and in the wizard start with Germany, Austria and Switzerland. A separator follows, and then all other countries, sorted by their name in the current language instead of the English one. Both lists are the same now, and the 29 countries without translation got one
