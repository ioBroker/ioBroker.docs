# Admin

The admin adapter is used to configure the whole ioBroker-Installation and all its adapters. 
It provides a web-interface, which can be opened by "http://<IP-Address of the server>:8081" 
in the web browser. This adapter is automatically installed together with ioBroker.

## Configuration
The configuration dialog of the adapter "admin" provides the following settings: 

![img_002](img/admin_img_002.jpg)

**IP:** the IP-address of the "admin" web-server can be chosen here. 
Different IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be selected. The default value is 0.0.0.0. 
If you think, that 0.0.0.0 is invalid setting, please let it stay there, because it 
is absolutely valid. If you change the address, you will be able to reach the web-server 
only through this address. **Port:** You can specify the port of the "admin" web-server. 
If there are more web servers on the PC or device the port must be customized to avoid problems 
of a double port allocation. **Coding:** enable this option if secure https protocol should be used. 

**Authentication:** If you want the authentication with login/password you should enable this check-box. 
Default password for user "admin" is "iobroker" **Buffer:** to speed up the load of the pages enable this option. 
Normally only the developer wants to have this option unchecked.

## Handling
The main page of the admin consist of several tabs. **Adapter:** Here the instances of 
a adapters can be installed or deleted. With the update button

on the top left we can get if the new versions of adapters are available.

adapter is coloured (red=in planning; orange=alpha; yellow=beta). The updates to a newer version of 
the adapter are made here also. If there is a newer version the lettering of the tab will be green. 
If the question mark icon in the last column is active you can get from there to web site with information of the adapter. 
The available adapter are sorted in alphabetical order. Already installed instance are in the upper part of the list.
