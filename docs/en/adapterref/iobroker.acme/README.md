## ACME adapter for ioBroker

This adapter generates certificates using ACME challenges.

## Usage

The adapter starts periodically (default at midnight) and after configuration updates to generate any required certificates (new or soon to expire).

Currently, orders are processed with the Let's Encrypt certificate authority and thus are free of charge.

Certificate details are stored in a 'certificate collection' object which includes other relevant details such as expiry date, domains to be secured and private key.
These objects are referenced by their collection ID.

Adapters which need certificates to secure their communications (e.g. [web adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.web)) are able to load and utilise certificate collections.

Storage and use is handled by an interface contained with the [core ioBroker controller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.js-controller).

### ACME Challenges

Two methods of challenge verification are implemented and at least one should be enabled in the configuration page.

Note that wildcard certificate orders can only be validated using the DNS-01 challenge.

#### HTTP-01

The adapter starts its own HTTP-01 challenge server on the configured port and address.

For a HTTP-01 challenge to be successful the challenge server's port/address **must** be publicly reachable as port 80 of the FQDN given in a collection common/alt names from the open internet.

Configure your firewall, reverse proxy, etc. accordingly.

Example scenarios:

1. The IoB host on which ACME is running is behind a router and that router has a publicly reachable IP address:

    Solution:

    - Configure ACME to run on any free port: Eg: 8092.
    - Configure the router to forward connections to port 80 of it's public address to port 8092 of the IoB host.
    - Configure the DNS name of the desired certificate common name to resolve to the public address of the router.

2. The IoB host on which ACME is running has a direct internet connection with a publicly reachable IP address:

    Solution:

    - Configure ACME adapter to liston on port 80.
    - Configure the DNS name of the desired certificate common name to resolve to the public address of the IoB host.

3. Scenario 1 & 2 are impossible because another service is running on port 80 of the publicly reachable IP address.

    Possible solutions:

    1. If the other service is an IoB adapter following port configuration naming standards ACME will stop it before attempting to order a certificate, use port 80 for the HTTP-01 challenge server, and restart any stopped adapter when done.

        Obviously this causes a short outage for the other adapter which may not be desirable.

    2. Use a DNS-01 challenge.
    3. Setup a named virtual host HTTP proxy on port 80 of the router or publicly reachable IoB host.

        - Give the existing service a different hostname to the one a certificate is required for and configure that hostname to resolve to the same address.
        - Configure the proxy to forward requests to either the existing service or ACME adapter based on the name used.

    4. Run ACME manually only when required port access is available. **Not recommended**, but should work:

        - Disable (stop) the ACME adapter after installation.
        - Shortly before certificate order or renewal is required (renewal will occur up to 7 days before expiry) manually perform the following steps:
            - Setup any firewall/port forwarding/other maintenance required to allow ACME to run on the configured port, and for that port to be accessible from the public internet.
            - Start ACME manually from the IoB Admin Instances page.
            - Wait for ACME to complete any certificate orders.
            - Stop ACME manually from the IoB Admin Instances page.
        - These steps will be required every time a certificate order/renewal is required and as such this method is **not recommended**. ACME is designed to facilitate a fully automated process.

#### DNS-01

Various DNS-01 challenge plugins are implemented for popular domain hosting platforms.
