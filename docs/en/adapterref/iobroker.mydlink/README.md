MyDlink Adapter for ioBroker. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allows to control power sockets or motion detectors from [D-Link](https://eu.dlink.com/uk/en/for-home/smart-home) from within ioBroker. 

Currently tested devices:

| Model | Type  | Image |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [DSP-W215](https://eu.dlink.com/uk/en/products/dsp-w215-smart-plug) | Socket (socket, temperature, current) | ![Image](admin/DSP_W215.png) | 
| [DCH-S150](https://eu.dlink.com/uk/en/products/dch-s150-motion-sensor) | Motion Detector (last motion detected) | ![Image](admin/DCH_S150.png) |

The adapter needs to poll the devices. So sensor readings and motion detection will be 
delayed by polling interval (can be set in config).

#### Configuration:
* global poll interval - Adapter will poll all devices in that interval, if they do not have a specific interval set. Set to 0 to disable.
* List of devices, each device with following settings:

<table>
<tr><td>Name</td><td>set a name here, must be unique (for mydlink devices)</td></tr>
<tr><td>IP</td><td>fill in IP address here, hostname should also work</td></tr>
<tr><td>PIN</td><td>PIN is printed on a sticker on the device, probably at the bottom</td></tr>
<tr><td>Poll interval</td><td>per device poll interval, leave empty to use global poll interval. <br /> Set 0 to disable polling. <br /><b>Recommendation:</b> Set a fast poll interval for sensors and a longer one for plugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>enable</td><td>if not enabled, will not be polled or controlled. <br />Devices that are not plugged in can be disabled to avoid error messages in the log.</td></tr>
</table>

The adapter does not interfere with the use of the app.
