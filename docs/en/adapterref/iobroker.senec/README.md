# ioBroker.senec

## senec adapter for ioBroker
Initially targeted at the Senec Home V2.1 System.
In the Senec.Home system, only selected values can be changed by the adapter. Use of this functionality is at your own risk and must be activated manually in the configuration beforehand.
Senec currently also no longer provides a reliable way to influence peak shaving via the web interface. For this purpose, mein-senec.de must be used.
Whether other systems (e.g. V3) also work with it depends on whether they are also based on lala.cgi and provide the same JSON information.
Even with integration into the Senec.Clound it is not guaranteed that the data can still be retrieved via the web interface (for this please report your experiences).

Systems that might work:
* Senec Home 4.0 / Blei
* Senec Home 6.0 Pb
* Senec Home 8.0 / Blei
* Senec Home 10.0 Pb
* Senec Home 5.0/7.5/10.0 / Lithium
* Senec Home 15.0 / Lithium
* Senec Home V2 5.0/7.5/10.0
* Senec Home V2 10.0 / Blei
* Senec Home V2.1 1ph / Lithium
* Senec.Home V3 Hybrid
* Senec.Home V3 Hybrid duo
* Senec Business 30.0 / Blei
* Senec Business V2 30.0 / Blei
* Senec Business 25.0 / Lithium
* Senec Business V2_2ph / Lithium
* Senec Business V2 3ph / Lithium
* ADS Tec
* OEM LG
* Solarinvert Storage 10.0 / Blei

SENEC Systems that don't provide a local webinterface might be monitored by using the API functionality only. Please contact the developer if you have any input on this.

## Installation
You is facilitated via the ioBroker web interface and the configuration will auto-open once installation is completed.

## Setup
In addition to the adapter installation you have to add an instance of the adapter.

### Configuration 
![Main Settings](media/mainSettings.png "Main Settings")

| Field         | Description |                                                                       
|:-------------|:-------------|
|SENEC System    |Type in the IP-address of your SENEC system (FQDN is also possible if you have a working local DNS).|
|Use https?|If the SENEC system has already been converted to https, this option must be activated.|
|Polling Interval High Priority Data|You can change the polling interval for high priority data (how often the Adapter reads from your Senec System), too. (Default: 10 seconds)|
|Polling Interval Low Priority Data|You can change the polling interval for low priority data (how often the Adapter reads from your Senec System), too. (Default: 60 minutes)<br>
Please be careful with high-frequency polling because this can render your SENEC machine unable to connect to the SENEC server!|
|Request-Timeout|If your network requires a higher timeout for requests sent to SENEC, please change the Request-Timeout in miliseconds accordingly. (Default: 5000 miliseconds)|
|Polling Retries|In case there is an issue communicating with SENEC the adapter will retry several times. You can adjust how often it will try to read from SENEC. (Default: 10)<br>
This does not apply to Adapter Start - if the System is unavailable to Adapter will stop.|
|Polling Retry Factor|To space retries apart a bit more you can adjust the Polling Retry Factor. (Default: 2) - Example: Using default settings the 1st retry will happen 20 seconds after the initial try, the 2nd will happen 40 seconds after the 2nd try. After each successful connect to SENEC, the number of retries is reset.|

Once finished setting up configuration, hit `SAVE AND CLOSE` to leave configuration dialogue. The adapter will automatically restart.

### Fenster "Additional HighPrio Polling Datapoints"
![Polling Settings](media/pollingSettings.png "Additional HighPrio Polling Datapoints")

| Field         | Description |                                                                       
|:-------------|:-------------|
|Disclaimer |To make changes to the polling behavior of the adapter, it must be confirmed that you are aware of possible risks and accept them willingly and knowingly. The developer of the adapter does not bear any responsibility.
|Data points for different ranges|Here you can specify additional data points to be polled with high priority. Only characters A-Z and digits 0-9 as well as , may be used for separation.|
|Add datapoints to poll?|Confirm here again that you really want to add the datapoints you specified to high priority polling.|

Attention! If the SENEC system is queried with too high a frequency and/or too many data points, this can lead to the fact that no more data can be transmitted to the SENEC servers (e.g. no current values in the app or on mein-senec.de)! Also, the SENEC system can restart unmotivated and/or no longer respond to requests. In this case, stopping the adapter and then correcting the settings will help.

## Usage
Here you can find a description of the states (incomplete list) and how to use them. All states of this adapter are read-only states.
Depending on the individual system states might not be available or additional states could be there.
If a state is not documented (or only partially documented) and you know what it represents, please send a pull request (or open a ticket with the information).
