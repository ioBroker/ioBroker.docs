**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to me as the developer.** More details see below!

This adapter for ioBroker connects to a M-Bus Master via TCP or serial to provide the status and details of connected M-Bus devices.

## Description of parameters
### Gateway IP / TCP Port
IP address and port of the M-Bus Master/Gateway when using TCP.

### Serial port / baud rate
Serial Port and Baud rate of M-Bus Master/Gateway.

### Update Interval
Interval in Seconds to update the data. Default (if empty) is 3600s (1h). Consider how the devices on the M-Bus bus are powered to prevent draining batteries. If you set the interval to 0 then the device is read only once on adapter start, but then no longer automatically.

### Device IDs
You can use primary (1-250) and secondary (16 characters long) M-Bus IDs

## How to read the Device on request?
In the created states for each device one state exists called "updateNow". When you set this to true (as control action with ack=false) the device is updated immediately. If an interval is configured the interval restarts after the data are received.

## Todo
* encrypted payload handling (if needed by anyone)

## How to report issues and feature requests

Please use GitHub issues for this.

Best is to set the adapter to Debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Then please get the logfile from disk (subdirectory "log" in ioBroker installation directory and not from Admin because Admin cuts the lines). If you do not like providing it in GitHub issue you can also send it to me via email (iobroker@fischer-ka.de). Please add a reference to the relevant GitHub issue AND also describe what I see in the log at which time.

## What is Sentry and what is reported to the servers?
Sentry.io is a way for developers to get an overview about errors from their applications. And exactly this is implemented in this adapter.

When the adapter crashes or an other Code error happens, this error message that also appears in the ioBroker log is submitted to our own Sentry server hosted in germany. When you allowed iobroker GmbH to collect diagnostic data then also your installation ID (this is just a unique ID **without** any additional infos about you, email, name or such) is included. This allows Sentry to group errors and show how many unique users are affected by such an error. All of this helps me to provide error free adapters that basically never crashs.  

## Changelog

### 2.1.4 (2020-02-08)
* (Apollon77) optimize adapter stop logic to prevent crashes (again)

### 2.1.3 (2020-02-05)
* (Apollon77) optimize adapter stop logic to prevent crashes
* (Apollon77) Switch Sentry to iobroker own instance hosted in germany

### 2.1.0 (2019-12-18)
* add compact mode
* move to more flexible serial port configuration
* add Sentry for error reporting

### 2.0.0 (2019-10-16)
* (lvogt) **BREAKING CHANGE** better handling for values with changing scaling based on the value - maybe incompatible with old values!
* (lvogt) add setting to force kWh values for energy

### 1.1.1 (2018-12-10)
* (Apollon77) make sure adapter is not communicating too fast at the beginning

### 1.1.0 (2018-05-06)
* (bluefox) Error tolerance
