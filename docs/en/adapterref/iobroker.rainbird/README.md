# ioBroker.rainbird

An ioBroker adapter for Rain Bird with LNK WiFi adapter. This project has no affiliation with Rain Bird.

Based on the python library "pyrainbird" from https://github.com/jbarrancos/pyrainbird and completely ported to NodeJS. The adapter makes a direct connection to the device through WiFi connection and is not using the Rain Bird cloud service.
