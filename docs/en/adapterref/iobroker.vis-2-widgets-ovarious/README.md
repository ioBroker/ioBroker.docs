This adapter contains various vis-2 widgets.

ok, actually, there is only one vis-2 widget, but some more are on my roadmap.

## JSON Template Widget

Using this widget, any data point with JSON data can be displayed as desired.
The display is done using a template format, which can be thought of as a combined form of HTML code + JavaScript + special tags that control the display of the JSON attributes.

### Attribute JSON datapoint

Selection of the data point with the corresponding JSON data.

#### Attribute Template

The template can be used to determine the appearance of the JSON data. All valid HTML tags (including CSS attributes in style tags) can be used in the template.
There are also special tags within which the JSON data is displayed and JavaScript instructions can be executed.

The template system works with certain tags.
The tags used have the following meaning

| `tag` | description                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <%=   | The content of the contained expression / variable will be escaped. |
| <%-   | The content of the contained expression / variable is unescaped.    |
| <%    | No output, is used for enclosed javascript instructions             |
| %>    | is generally a closing tag that completes one of the previous ones  |

Everything that is outside of these tags is displayed exactly as it is or if it is HTML interpreted as HTML. (see e.g. the p-tag, div-tag, small-tag
Within the template you have 2 predefined variables available

The JSON data is passed to the template with the prefix data. In addition, the current widgetID is also available as a variable so that it can be specified in individual CSS instructions.

##### Example object

```json
{
  "onearray": ["one", "two"],
  "oneobject": {
    "attribute1": 1,
    "attribute2": 2
  },
  "onenumber": 123,
  "onetext": "onetwothree"
}
```

With the above example, attributes could be output as follows

```html
<%- data.onenumber %> <%- data.onetext %>
```

**Result**

```html
123 onetwothree
```

Arrays can be accessed via an index. The index always starts with 0. However, there are also fake arrays where the index does not start with 0 or even consists of text. Here the rules for objects apply. In the example above, this would be

```html
<%- data.onearray[0] %> <%- data.onearray[1] %>
```

##### Result

```html
one two
```

If you try to output an array directly without an index, the template outputs all elements separated by commas

```html
<%- data.onearray %>
```

**Result**

```html
one,two
```

Arrays can also consist of a collection of objects. The example here contains only a simple array. An example of arrays with objects will be given later.

```html
<% for (var i = 0; i < data.onearray.length ; i++ ) { %> <%- data.onearray[i] %> <% } %>
```

**Result**

```html
one two
```

**Objects** can contain individual attributes, arrays or objects again. This means that JSON data can be nested to any depth.

Attributes of an object can be addressed using dot notation or bracket notation. The dot notation only works if the attribute conforms to certain naming conventions (first character must be a letter, rest numbers or letters or underscore).
The bracket notation also works for attributes that do not conform to the naming convention.

**Dot notation**

```html
<%- data.oneobject.attribute1 %>
```

**Bracket notation**

```html
<%- data.oneobject["attribute1"] %>
```

**Result for both examples**

```html
1
```

Loop over the attributes of an object

```html
<% for (var prop in data.oneobject) { %> <%- "data.oneobject." + prop + " = " + data.oneobject[prop] %> <% } %>
```

**Result**

```html
data.oneobject.attribute1 = 1 data.oneobject.attribute2 = 2
```

**Advanced use case**

In the examples above, only the pure output was covered. The template can now also be enriched with HTML tags to achieve a specific layout. Here is an example:

```html
<h3>Output</h3>
<style>
  .mycssclassproperty {
    color: green;
  }
  .mycssclassdata {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
<% for (var prop in data.oneobject) { %>
<div>
  <span class="mycssclassproperty"><%- "data.oneobject." + prop + " = " %></span>
  <span class="mycssclassdata"><%- data.oneobject[prop] %></span>
</div>
<% } %>
```

**Result**

```html
data.oneobject.attribute1 = 1 data.oneobject.attribute2 = 2
```
