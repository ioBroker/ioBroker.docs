## What is this adapter?

This adapter integrates your Fronius Wattpilot EV charger with ioBroker, allowing you to monitor and control your charging station. The Wattpilot is an intelligent electric vehicle charging solution that can be integrated into your smart home system.

**üåü Key Features:**
- Real-time monitoring of charging status
- Remote control of charging parameters
- Cloud and local connection support

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before installing the adapter, you need to set up your Wattpilot:

1. **Complete Wattpilot Setup**: Finish the initial setup using the official Fronius Wattpilot app and **remember your password**
2. **Connect to WiFi**: In the app, go to the "Internet" tab and connect your Wattpilot to your WiFi network
3. **Find IP Address**: You'll need your Wattpilot's IP address using one of these methods:
  - **Router Method**: Check your router's web interface for connected devices
  - **App Method**: In the Wattpilot app, tap on the WiFi name after connection. You'll see network details including the IP address

> üí° **Important**: It's highly recommended to assign a static IP address to your Wattpilot in your router settings to prevent connection issues.

### Adapter Installation

1. Install the adapter from the ioBroker "Adapters" page
2. Create a new instance of the fronius-wattpilot adapter
3. In the instance configuration:
  - Enter your Wattpilot's **IP address**
  - Enter your Wattpilot **password**
  - Configure other settings as needed
4. Save the configuration

If everything is configured correctly, the adapter will connect and start creating data points.

## How to Use the Adapter

### Reading Data

The adapter automatically creates data points for all Wattpilot values. You can use these like any other data points in ioBroker for:
- Visualization in VIS or other frontends
- Logic in scripts and Blockly
- Automation rules

**Data Modes:**
- **Key Points Only** (default): Shows only the most important values
- **All Values**: Uncheck the "Key points only" option to see all available API data

### Controlling Your Wattpilot

#### Direct State Control (NEW!)

You can now directly control important Wattpilot functions by writing to the states.

#### Advanced Control via set_state

For more advanced control, use the `set_state` data point with this format:
```
stateName;value
```

**Available states:**
- **amp**: `6-16` (charging current in Amperes)
- **cae**: `true` or `false` (‚ö†Ô∏è disables cloud functionality - may require restart)

**Examples:**
```
amp;10          // Set charging current to 10A
```

## Examples and Use Cases

### Solar Integration Example

Check out our [Blockly example](https://github.com/tim2zg/ioBroker.fronius-wattpilot/blob/main/examples/example-Blockly.xml) that shows how to:
- Monitor your solar power production
- Automatically adjust Wattpilot charging current based on excess solar power

**How to use the example:**
1. Copy the content from the example file
2. In ioBroker Blockly, click the "Import blocks" icon (upper right corner)
3. Paste the content and adapt it to your setup

### Common Automations

- **Time-based charging**: Start charging during off-peak hours
- **Solar surplus charging**: Charge only when excess solar power is available
- **Presence detection**: Start/stop charging based on car presence
- **Load balancing**: Adjust charging current based on household power consumption

## Technical Details

The adapter connects to the Wattpilot's WebSocket interface and converts incoming data into ioBroker data points. It supports both local WiFi connections and cloud-based connections.

**Connection Types:**
- **Local WiFi** (recommended): Direct connection to your Wattpilot
- **Cloud**: Connection via Fronius cloud services

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Connection failed**: Check IP address and password
- **Frequent disconnections**: Assign a static IP to your Wattpilot
- **Missing data points**: Try enabling "All Values" mode
- **Cloud connection issues**: Verify the `cae` setting

**‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:** This adapter uses unofficial APIs. Use at your own risk and be careful when modifying settings that could affect your device's operation.
