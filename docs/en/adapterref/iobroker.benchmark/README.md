## benchmark adapter for ioBroker
Benchmark your system.

## Important: Information for users
Note, that the purpose of the adapter, in its current state, is mainly to benchmark different scenarios to gather 
insights on changes on js-controller level.
The Benchmark Tests can take very long and can cause high loads on your system. Also note, that by default the benchmark adapter
runs in an isolated mode, which will disable all adapters and only keep the controller and itself alive. Furthermore, the adapter
always needs to be run with instance number `0`.

## How to add a new test?
1. Create a new TypeScript file in src/lib/activeTests, with a class which inherits from TestUtils
2. Define the three (five) steps of your test (execute is automatically measured)
3. Ooptional: If your test has some requierments, e.g. controller needs to be `>=3.0.0`, please pass the requirements to
the parent constructor
4. Add your test to src/lib/allTests.ts
5. Add a button and translation for your test to admin/jsonConfig.json

### Test requirements
Some tests may have requirements. If the system does not fulfill the requirements, the test will be skipped.
In the constructor you should pass the requirements to the parent class, like

```typescript
public constructor(adapter: AdapterInstance) {
    super(adapter, {freeMemory: 2000});
}
```

Currently, the following requirements are supported:

- `controllerVersion` - if methods are tested which were introduced with a specific controller version, the benchmark 
adapter should not try to run these tests on a non-supporting controller
- `freeMemory` - define the required memory of the test, this is only necessary if you e.g. add a lot of instances

## Test description
### getStates
Executes `iterations` times `getState`.

### getStatesAlias
Executes `iterations` times `getState` on an alias.

### getStatesAliasRead
Executes `iterations` times `getState` on an alias. The alias has a simple read function.

### getStatesMulti
Creates 10,000 states, then executes `iterations` times `getStates` on them.

### getStatesMultiAlias
Creates 10,000 alias states, then executes `iterations` times `getStates` on them. 

### idle
Just waits `iterations` ms.

### messages
Creates a secondary benchmark instance. The controller instance will then send `iterations` messages to the secondary instance. 
If all messages are recevied, the test is finished.

### objectsCreation
Creates `iterations` objects via `setObject`.

### objectsDeletion
Deletes `iterations` objects via `delObject`.

### objectViewEqual
Creates 10,000 objects while 50 % of them are relevant for the object view. Then it executes `iterations` object views.

### objectViewLarge
Creates 10,000 objects while 98 % of them are relevant for the object view. Then it executes `iterations` object views.

### objectViewSmall
Creates 10,000 objects while only 2 % of them are relevant for the object view. Then it executes `iterations` object views.

### setStates
Sets `iterations` states via `setState`

### setStatesNonStrict
Sets `iterations` states via `setState`, but `strictObjectChecks` are disabled.

### setStateParallel
Adds 30 secondary instances, every instance will set `iterations` states. On system level, the instances are setting these states in parallel, but on instance level, the previous `setState` needs to be finished until the next one is set.
This test aims to benchmark multicore systems.

__Requirements__: 2 GB of free memory

### statesDeletion
Deletes `iterations` states via `delState`.

### statesSubscription
The controller instance subscribes on a specific namespace. 4 secondaries each set `iterations / 4` states. As soon as the controller received all `iterations` publishes, the test is finished.

### statesSubscriptionAlias
The controller instance subscribes on an alias namespace. 4 secondaries each set `iterations / 4` alias states. As soon as the controller received all `iterations` publishes, the test is finished.

### statesSubscriptionAliasWrite
The controller instance subscribes on an alias namespace. 4 secondaries each set `iterations / 4` alias states. As soon as the controller received all `iterations` publishes, the test is finished.
The alias contains a simple write function.

### statesSubscriptionSingle
Ten secondaries each subscribe on the same `iterations` states. Instead of using one `subscribe` call each perform `iterations` single subscribe calls. As soon as all `Ã¬terations` are received by every secondary, the test is finished.
