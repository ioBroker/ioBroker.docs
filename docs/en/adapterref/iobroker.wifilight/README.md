**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Description

ioBroker Adapter for WiFi Light

## Info
Supports LW12, LD382 and LD382A.
Support for Mi-Light/LimitlessLED RGBW added.

## Initial Creation
This adapter was initially created by @soef at https://github.com/soef/ioBroker.wifilight but not maintained anymore, so we moved it to iobroker-community so that bugs could be fixed. Thanks @soef for his work.

### How to use the command state:
+ Possible identifiers are: ``red, r, green, g, blue, b, bri, sat, transition, on, off``
+ The string can be a JSON with or without parentheses. 
+ You can also assign a value by =
+ Range of colors: `0..255` 
+ Range of bri: `0..100`

Some Examples:
```
r = 100; g = 250, b = 100
r: 0, g: 0, b = 255
red: 200, green: 0, blue: 0
{r:100, b: 200, transition: 20}
off
on
{on:0}
```
To change the color, you do not have to use all three values.
For example, `red = 0`, blue and green will stay unchanged.

### r, g, b, w States:
+ Values 0..255
+ \#rrggbb[ww]
