## LG ESS Home adapter for ioBroker

An iobroker adapter for a LG ESS hybrid inverter. With this adapter, the status of the inverter can be read. It is also possible to operate the inverter.

## Configuration

### Getting the password

1. Download the file [LG_Ess_Password.exe](https://github.com/Morluktom/ioBroker.lg-ess-home/tree/master/tools)
1. Connect the computer to the WLAN of the LG_ESS system. (WLAN password is on the type plate)
1. Start LG_Ess_Password.exe (At least .Net Framework 4.5 required)
1. Make a note of your password

For those, who don't like exe: (Thanks grex1975)\
you can use any REST Client to get the password:
1. connect to the WLAN of the LG_ESS
1. Execute a GET request\
	Url: https://192.168.23.1/v1/user/setting/read/password \
	Headers: "Charset": "UTF-8", "Content-Type": "application/json"\
	Body: "key": "lgepmsuser!@#"
	
This should give you the password and a status in return.
