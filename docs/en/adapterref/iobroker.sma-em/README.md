### Info
This adapter reads information from SMA Energy Meter and SMA Home Manager 2.

### States
- Total and Counter of active power, reactive power, apparent power
- cosphi, Total Harmonic Distortion, Voltage
- Detailed Each of the 3 phases with regard of active power, reactive power, apparent power, cosphi, Amperage, Voltage
- Detailed Each of the 3 phases with surplus of active power, reactive power, apparent power, cosphi, Amperage, Voltage
- Detailed Each of the 3 phases counter
- Serial Number of SMA Energy Meter

### Options
- Selection options over each individual phase L1 / L2 / L3
- Selection non-extended Mode for Total and Counter of active power
- Selection extended Mode for reactive power, apparent power, cosphi, Amperage, Voltage (requires more computing power)

### Folder-Structure

- L1 - Phase 1
- L2 - Phase 2
- L3 - Phase 3

### States-Structure

Example:  

          pregard P-active power / regard 
          qregard Q-reactive power / regard
          sregard S-apparent power / regard
         
          psurplus P-active power / surplus
          qsurplus Q-reaktive power /surplus
          ssurplus S-apparent power /surplus
