### Info
This adapter reads information from SMA Energy Meter (EMETER-20) and Sunny Home Manager 2 (HM-20).
It supports the SMA-EMETER-protocol-2. Thus also compatible energy meters from other manufacturers will work.

SMA Energy Meter and Sunny Home Manager 2 multicast datagrams with their energy measurement data to the network every second.
The SMA Energy Meter Adapter receives these multicast messages and stores them as iobroker states.
A single instance of the SMA Energy Meter Adapter detects all SMA Energy Meters and Sunny Home Managers in all connected networks.


![States](docs/en/img/overview.png)

### States in non-extended mode
- Instantaneous values of total active power consumption (pregard) and active power feed-in (psurplus)
- Energy meter values of total active power consumption (pregardcounter) and active power feed-in (psurpluscounter)
- SMA Time Tick counter, Timestamp of last Message received, 
- Serial Number, SUSyID, Software Version of SMA Energy Meter and Sunny Home Manager
- Detailed values for each of the individual phases L1 / L2 / L3 (optional):
  - Instantaneous values of active power consumption (pregard) and active power feed-in (psurplus) per phase
  - Energy meter values of active power consumption (pregardcounter) and active power feed-in (psurpluscounter) per phase
  
### States in extended mode
In addition to the states in non-extended mode, the following values are available in extended mode
- Instantaneous values of total reactive power consumption (qregard) and reactive power feed-in (qsurplus)
- Energy meter values of total reactive power consumption (qregardcounter) and reactive power feed-in (qsurpluscounter)
- Instantaneous values of total apparent power consumption (sregard) and apparent power feed-in (ssurplus)
- Energy meter values of total apparent power consumption (sregardcounter) and apparent power feed-in (ssurpluscounter)
- cosphi (power factor)
- grid frequency (only available with Sunny Home Manager 2, SMA Energy Meter currently does not provide any grid frequency values)
- Detailed for each of the individual phases L1 / L2 / L3 (optional):
  - Instantaneous values of reactive and apparent power consumption/feed-in per phase
  - Energy meter values of reactive and apparent power consumption/feed-in per phase
  - Voltage and Amperage per phase

### Configuration Options

![Settings](docs/en/img/adminpage.png)

- Multicast IP: The default setting is 239.12.255.254. 
- Multicast Port: The default setting for the UDP port is 9522.
  (Both should not be changed, as SMA devices always use this IP address and port)
- Details L1 - L3: These selection options can be used to display details of each phase.
- Extended Mode: Provides more detailed information such as reactive power, apparent power, cosphi, grid frequency, voltage, amperage
  (Do not configure Details L1-L3 and Extended Mode simultaneously since this puts a high load on the ioBroker system)
