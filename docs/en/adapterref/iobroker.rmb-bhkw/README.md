## RMB CHP Adapter for ioBroker

Reads data from RMB CHP units (e.g. Remeha eLina) via the RMB Energie customer portal [rmbenergie.com](https://www.rmbenergie.com/login-report/) and makes them available as objects in ioBroker. Thus, the data can be accessed even without the optional ModBus interface of the plant.


## Usage

The adapter runs as a "scheduled" adapter and pulls the data in the specified interval from the customer portal. The system itself pushes the data only about every 15min to the customer portal, so the data are unfortunately not real-time data. It also makes little sense to set the interval of the adapter to a very short period. The default value for the data request is 5min.

The adapter uses a headless version of the Chromium browser to parse the data from the customer portal. Either the Chromium version supplied by the adapter can be used for this, or an external one. 

### Supplied version of Chrome
If the supplied Chromium browser is to be used, the dependencies must be fulfilled on the host system of ioBroker. On installation, the adapter will try and install any missing dependencies. Should this not work and any of the dependencies are missing, the adapter will throw an error in the log, indicating the missing library. These can be installed on a Debian/Ubuntu system for example with:

```
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates fonts-liberation libappindicator3-1 libasound2 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libatk1.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 libfontconfig1 libgbm1 libgcc1 libglib2. 0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libnss3 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 lsb-release wget xdg-utils
```

If ioBroker is installed on a different operating system, the package names of the dependencies may be different - a quick Google search will probably help. These must then be installed for the respective operating system. Alternatively, you can switch to using an external browser.

### External Chrome Browser
If the supplied browser cannot be used due to missing dependencies, it is recommended to run the Chromium browser as a separate container. For this purpose, the image [browserless/chrome](https://hub.docker.com/r/browserless/chrome/) is recommended. This image can be executed with the command

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 browserless/chrome
```
and is then accessible at `http://[IP-of-docker-host]:3000`. If the web interface of the container appears, it works as expected and the corresponding path can be entered in the adapter configuration.

## Changelog
### 1.1.0 (2024-08-18)
* Updated dependencies

### 1.0.7 (2023-11-30)
* BREAKING CHANGE due to renaming of object ids

* Changed objects to read-only
* Changed logs to english
* Changed some logs from info to debug

### 1.0.6 (2023-05-29)
* Added option to allow insecure certificates, as rmbenegie portal is not updating their certificates in time, leading to data not being able to be pulled
