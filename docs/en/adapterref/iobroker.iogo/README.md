This adapter is adding extra features to the smarthome app ioGo https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.nisnagel.iogo.
Please visit www.iogo.app for more information on how to get started.


## Configuration
You need a valid licence key to use this adapter.
A licence can be bought after creating an account at https://www.iogo.app.

Please enter your account information (email/password) in the instance configuration.

## Usage
You can send message to all authenticated users over messageBox `sendTo('iogo', 'New message')`
or to specific user `sendTo('iogo', {user: 'Username', text: 'Test message'})`.
User must be created before (please read the application documentation for further details).

It is possible to specify more than one recipient (just separate the Usernames by comma). For example: Recipient: "User1,User4,User5"

Example how to send notification customized message with javascript:
```
sendTo('iogo', {
    user:                   'Username',
    text:                   'New message',
    title:                  'VIP News'
});
```

And one example with blockly:

Callbacks are supported as well:
```
sendTo('iogo', {title: 'News', text: 'New message'}, function (res) {
    console.log('Sent to ' + res + ' users');
});
```

Just send the path to your image instead of text or use url attribute `sendTo('iogo.0', 'absolute/path/file.png')`
```
sendTo('iogo', {
    user:                   'Username',
    text:                   'New message',
    title:                  'VIP News',
    url:                    'absolute/path/file.png'
});
```

**Possible options**:
- `user`: Single user or list of users
- `text`: The message itself
- `title`: The notification's title
- `url`: Absolute path to an image
- `expiry`: Expiration time in seconds
