#### Description

ioBroker Adapter to find Apple devices


#### Info

The adapter tries to read its own location from the adapter ioBroker.javascript. If it is not available, the location of the external IP will be determined. Otherwise 0.0+0.0 will be taken. The location is used zu calculate the distance to the device.

#### Two-step verification (2FA Authentisierung)
If you are using the "new" Two-Step verification/athentication follow this steps:
- Step 1: Connect the adapter with your username and password.
- Step 2: Confirm your registration on one of your devices
- Step 3: Change the password in the adapter by simply adding the 6-digit code
