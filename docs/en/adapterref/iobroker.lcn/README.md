[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/iobroker.lcn.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/iobroker.lcn/)

This adapter allows to connect Local Control Network [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) to ioBroker.

## Supported Gateways
- LCN-PKE

![pke](img/lcn-pke.png)

- LCN-PKU with LCN-PCHK

**Don't forget, that ioBroker.lcn will block one LCN Connection License.**

The configuration and modules will be automatically detected by scan, that must be triggered manually from the configuration dialog and can be repeated any time again.

## Types
Following read and write groups are supported:
- Analog values (output/input)
- Relays (output)
- Sensors (input)
- LEDs (output / input)
- Variables (input)

## Variables
To apply the valid convert functions to variables, the variables must have the valid roles. Following roles are supported:

- **value.temperature** - temperature in celsius
- **value.brightness** - Lux (I- input) in lux
- **value.speed.wind** - wind speed in m/s
- **value.voltage** - voltage in Volt
- **value.current** - current in Ampere
- **value.sun.azimuth** - sun azimuth
- **value.sun.elevation** - sun elevation

## Display
For every device you can activate if it has display or not.

## Regulator (Regler)
For every device you can activate if it has regulators or not.

## Settings
- Reconnect interval(sec) - how often adapters tries to connect. Default ever 30 seconds. 
- Connect timeout(ms) - how long adapter waits for connection response inclusive authentication. Default 6 seconds. 
- Scan response timeout(ms) - how long adapter waits for answers by scan of modules.
- Response timeout(ms) - timeout for control commands
- Ping Interval(sec) - how often adapter sends ping requests 
- Ping response timeout(ms) - timeout for ping requests
- IN/OUT Relays are the same - if the "out" and "in" relays are the same thing or if these relays are different ones.

## How to use
After the first start the devices must be scanned. It can be done in the configuration dialog with scan button
