This adapter for ioBroker connects to a defined NUT server to provide the status and details of a connected UPS/USV as ioBroker states, so that it can be used there.

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Description of parameters
### host_ip
IP address of the NUT server. NUT needs to run in server mode and needs to be accessible by the computer the
iobroker NUT adapter runs on. So check firewall settings if you have problems and allow the access. If the UPS
is connected locally you can also use 127.0.0.1 or localhost.

### host_port
Port of NUT. The default port is <b>3493</b>

### ups_name
Name of the UPS as defined in the NUT configuration of the NUT server.</p>
Hints:
- If you want to connect to an UPS connected to a Synology diskstation the name is simply "ups".
- If you want to connect to an UPS connected to a QNAP NAS the name is simply "qnapups".

### update_interval
Interval in Seconds to update the data. Default is 300s

## UPS-Monitor Notifies
Included is a small linux shell-script at scripts/nut-notify.sh which can be configured in upsmon.

The script needs execute rights (chmod +x nut-notify.sh).

It should be added to /etc/nut/upsmon.conf like:

```
NOTIFYCMD "cd /opt/iobroker/;./nut-notify.sh"
```

Additionally configure all relevant notify messages like:

```
NOTIFYFLAG ONLINE       SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
NOTIFYFLAG ONBATT       SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
NOTIFYFLAG LOWBATT      SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
NOTIFYFLAG FSD          SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
NOTIFYFLAG COMMOK       SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
NOTIFYFLAG COMMBAD      SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
NOTIFYFLAG SHUTDOWN     SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
NOTIFYFLAG REPLBATT     SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
NOTIFYFLAG NOCOMM       SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
NOTIFYFLAG NOPARENT     SYSLOG+WALL+EXEC
```
Important is the added "EXEC" flag.

One simple example for a nut-notify.sh script is:
```
#! /bin/sh
# NUT adapter notify script.

logger -t nut-notify "Notify iobroker $UPSNAME -> $NOTIFYTYPE"
/opt/iobroker/iobroker message nut notify "{\"upsname\":\"$UPSNAME\",\"notifytype\":\"$NOTIFYTYPE\"}"

```


## Troubleshooting
If you have problems and the adapter do not deliver the data you can use the two scripts in directory "test"
of the adapter installation (so normally in node_modules/iobroker.nut/test relative to your iobroker installation
directory) to try it out on the commandline. Call the scripts using "node filename.js" to see the awaited parameters.</p>
* **test_upslist.js**: Connects to the NUT server and returns a list of available UPS names
* **test_upsvars.js**: Connects to the NUT server for a defined UPS and returns a list of available UPS variables
