## notification-manager adapter for ioBroker
Manage ioBroker notifications, e.g. by sending them as messages

### General description
This adapter allows to redirect the ioBroker internal `Notifications` to messenger adapters which support 
the `Notification System`. If you are missing an adapter, please open a ticket on the corresponding adapter.

### Configuration
For each `category` you are able to configure if the `category` should be active. If the category is not active,
the `notification-manager` will not handle anything for this specific `category`. 

Additionally, you can configure 
if the `notification-manager` should suppress certain `categories`. If a `notification` for a suppressed 
`category` is registered, the adapter will immediately clear this `notification` without sending you any messages.

Finally, you can configure supported messaging adapters. Whenever a new `notification` for an `active` (and `non-suppressed`) 
`category` is generated, the adapter will send the `notification` via the first configured adapter. If sending the message was
successful, the `notification-manager` will clear the `notification`. IF sending was not successful it will re-try with the second adapter.

Whenever a category is `active` but has not configured any specific settings yet, then the adapter will use the configured 
fallback settings. New categories are always `active` by default to ensure you will be notified. This means whenever a new `category`
is implemented by some adapter, the fallback settings for the given `severity` will be applied.

You can further define to just `suppress` a category. The `notification-manager` will then simply acknowledge the notification, so that is 
does not appear in your system. 

Since js-controller version 7, adapters have the possibility to add additional `contextData` to notifications. This is for example used
to display specific actions for the user in the Admin GUI. By default, the `notification-manager` will send you these notifications and will 
__NOT__ delete them, so that these stay present for later user interactions. However, if you decide that you don't need such interactions
fort certain `category` you can disable them via the checkbox.

### Registering user-centric notifications
As a user you at best know, when you want to be notified about specific situations in your system. 
Thus, the `notification-manager` provides you with an interface to register your own notifications inside
the ioBroker notification system. Three categories are supported, one for each severity level `notify`, `info` and `alert`.

The notifications can be registered via `sendTo` 

```ts
(async () => {
    try {
        await sendToAsync('notification-manager.0', 'registerUserNotification', { category: 'notify', message: 'Your delivery has arrived' });
    } catch (e) {
        log(`Could not register notification: ${e}`, 'error');
    }
})();
```

### Requirements for messaging adapters
Please set the `common.supportedMessages.notifications` flag to `true` in your `io-package.json`.

Whenever a new notification should be delivered via the messaging adapter, `notification-manager` will send a message
to the configured instance. 

The messages consist of the command `sendNotification` and a message with the following structure: 

```json
{
  "host": "system.host.moritz-ThinkPad-P16-Gen-1",
  "scope": {
    "name": "System-Benachrichtigungen",
    "description": "Diese Benachrichtigungen werden vom ioBroker-System erfasst und weisen auf Probleme hin, die überprüft und behoben werden sollten."
  },
  "category": {
    "instances": {
      "system.adapter.backitup.0": {
        "messages": [
          {
            "message": "Restart loop detected",
            "ts": 1684074961226
          }
        ]
      },
      "system.adapter.notification-manager.0": {
        "messages": [
          {
            "message": "Restart loop detected",
            "ts": 1684075183094
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "description": "Eine Adapterinstanz stürzt beim Start häufig ab und wurde aus diesem Grund gestoppt. Die Protokolldatei muss vor dem Neustart der Instanz überprüft werden.",
    "name": "Probleme mit häufig abstürzenden Adapterinstanzen",
    "severity": "alert"
  }
}
```

Where `category.instances` shows the affected adapter instances for this notification. 
Additionally, the category has an i18n description and an i18n name. 
The same properties exist for the scope of the category. Additionally, the affected host is included.

After sending the notification, the `notification-manager` expects an answer with the property `{ sent: true }` 
if the messaging adapter was able to deliver the notification, else it should respond with `{ sent: false }`.
