This adapter uses the service `Sentry.io` to automatically report exceptions and code errors and new device schemas to me as the developer. More details see below!

## Description

DNScope allows you to update your dynamic DNS account directly in ioBroker.
It is possible to update your DNS account with the current IP address of your environment without any detours or additional hardware.

You can determine the interval at which the check and update should take place. 
The default interval is 10 minutes.

The following DynDNS providers are currently supported:

* IPv64
* DuckDNS
* NoIP
* Dynv6
* Custom

When selecting `Custom`, it is possible to specify a direct update URL in order to integrate any provider that supports this.

---

## Adapter configuration

Your access data to the DynDNS service is required for the adapter configuration.
Depending on the provider, this can be a token or a user name/password.

You must also enter the domain that is to be updated. 

If you have several domains that are to be updated, you need one instance per domain
