## Features
The following features come with this adapter:
- __Send commands__ (`start`, `stop`, `resume`, `pause`, `dock`) to your Roomba
- Retrieve __device states__, such as battery, docked, full / inserted bin (see [Channels & States](#channels--states) for full list)
- Retrieve __device configuration__, such as preferences, network or schedule settings (see [Channels & States](#channels--states) for full list)
- Retrieve __device statistics__, such as total missions, hours on docking station, etc. (see [Channels & States](#channels--states) for full list)
- Retrieve information about __current mission__ (when your Roomba is cleaning), such as start and end time, total runtime, sqm cleaned, etc. (only on supported Roomba\'s see [Supported Roomba's / Firmware versions](#supported-roombas--firmware-versions))
- __Draw map based on the mission data__ received (only on supported Roomba\'s)
- __Web Interface__ that shows the status and map of the current as well as previous / archived missions: 
  ![Roomba Interface](img/roomba.interface.png)


## Installation
ioBroker.roomba needs [canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) in order to draw maps of the Roomba missions. ioBroker will try to install this dependency with ioBroker.roomba installation.

Though, you probably have to install package dependencies of canvas (and canvas itself) with the following command:

### Linux
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev
```

Furthermore, run the following command __in the ioBroker.roomba directory__ (`/opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.roomba`):

```
sudo npm install canvas --unsafe-perm=true
```

### Windows
1. Make sure you have `node-gyp` installed via
   ```
   npm install -g node-gyp
   ```
   
2. Make sure you have build essentials installed via
   ```
   npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
   ```
   
3. Download GTK 2 (for [Win32](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.24/gtk+-bundle_2.24.10-20120208_win32.zip) or [Win64](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win64/gtk+/2.22/gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101229_win64.zip)) and unzip it (e.g. to `C:\path\to\GTK2`)
4. Run 
   ```
   node-gyp rebuild --GTK_Root=C:\path\to\GTK2
   ```
5. Install canvas from within the iobroker.roomba folder
   ```
   cd C:\path\to\iobroker\node_modules\iobroker.roomba
   npm install canvas
   ```

For details, see https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/Installation:-Windows.


## Setup instructions
### Automated setup
To automatically setup ioBroker.roomba following the instructions in the admin panel of ioBroker.roomba.

**ATTENTION**: The authentication credentials are not the same as you are using in the smartphone app!

1. Make sure the ioBroker.roomba adapter is started.
2. Make sure your robot is on the Home Base and powered on (green lights on).
3. Then press and hold the HOME button on your robot until it plays a series of tones (about 2 seconds).
4. Release the button and your robot will flash WIFI light.
5. Then come back here press the button to retrieve IP and credentials.

If the automated process fails retrieving your credentials, please use the manual setup.

### Manual setup
For manual setup see https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980#how-to-get-your-usernameblid-and-password.

## Smart Home / Alexa integration using ioBroker.javascript
### Send Map via Telegram when mission is finished
This requires the ioBroker adapter ioBroker.telegram to be installed (https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.telegram).

Create a script in the "common" folder of ioBroker.javascript and add the following listener to it:

```javascript
var _fs = require('fs');

/*
 * MISSION END: Send map
 * 
 */
var message = "%device.name% finished at %missions.current.endedDateTime% cleaning %missions.current.sqm% sqm in %missions.current.runtime% seconds (%missions.current.error% errors).";
var ns = 'roomba.0';
var imagePath = 'tmp/';

on({id: ns + '.missions.current.ended', change: 'any'}, function(obj)
{
    if (!obj.state || !obj.state.val) return;
    
    // replace variables with state values
    var pos, variable, state, value;
    while (message.indexOf('%') > -1)
    {
        pos = message.indexOf('%');
        variable = message.substring(pos, message.indexOf('%', pos+1)+1);
        state = getState(ns + '.' + variable.replace(/%/g, ''));
        
        if (state !== null && state.val !== null)
            value = state.val
        else
        {
            log('State ' + variable.replace(/%/g, '') + ' not found!', 'warn');
            value =  '';
        }

        if (typeof value === "boolean") value = value === true ? 'with' : 'no';
        message = message.replace(RegExp(variable, 'gi'), value);
    }
    
    // console
    log(message);
    
    // get image
    var img = getState(ns + '.missions.current.mapImage').val;

    if (img !== null && img.indexOf('data:image/png;base64,') > -1)
    {
        _fs.writeFile(imagePath + 'image.png', img.replace(/^data:image\/png;base64,/, ''), 'base64', function(err)
        {
            if (err !== null)
                log(err.message, 'warn');
            else
                sendTo('telegram', {text: imagePath + 'image.png', message: message});
        });
    }
});
```

_2019-05-04 fixed error that prevented sending the map_ 

You may edit the variable ```message``` to any notification you would like to receive with the map. You may use ```%name-of-state%``` to retrieve the value of a state within the ioBroker.roomba object tree.
