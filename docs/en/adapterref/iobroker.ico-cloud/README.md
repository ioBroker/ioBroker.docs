## ico adapter for ioBroker

ICO Pool sensor (by ondilo) allows to monitor the state and temperature of the water in your pool and recommend actions to take.

The adapter connects to the Ondilo cloud service and retrieves all measurements.

### Configuration 
You can define the poll interval in the settings (in minutes). 
It is necessary to start the login process in the settings, too.


### Attribution 
This adapter is **not** developed or owned by Ondilo but the ioBroker community.

Icon and name of ICO and Ondilo are property of Ondilo.
