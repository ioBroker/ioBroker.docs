## ioBroker Adapter for Dyson Air Purifiers and fans

This adapter connects ioBroker to various Dyson Air Purifiers.

## Features

Connects your Dyson fans, fan heaters, air purifiers, and air humidifiers to ioBroker.

* Reads values from devices and sensors
* Can control devices by giving you the ability to change some values (main power, oscillation, heating, fan speed, ...)
* Reads device list from Dyson servers

## Installation

### sentry.io
This adapter uses sentry.io to collect details on crashes and report it automated to the author. The [ioBroker.sentry](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry)
plugin is used for it. Please refer to the [plugin homepage](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry) for detailed information
on what the plugin does, which information is collected and how to disable it, if you don't like to support the author with
you're information on crashes.

### Prerequisites

* This adapter needs Node.js >= version 10
* At least js-Controller 3.0.0 is required
* At least Admin 4.0.9 is required
* To get this adapter running you'll need a Dyson account.
* Make sure to add your fan to your account. Either via App or online.

### Adapter installation

#### Using npm

Run ```npm install iobroker.dysonairpurifier``` on your ioBroker installation to grab the latest version of this adapter from the npm repository.

#### Alternative: Using GitHub URL

Install through the ioBroker Admin UI by pointing it to the latest stable release on GitHub:
<https://github.com/Grizzelbee/ioBroker.dysonairpurifier/tarball/master/>

You can also install older release versions using this methods (by pointing to a version tag, e.g., ```v0.6.0``` instead of ```master```in the URL), but the most recent one is generally preferred.

### Config-data needed

* Dyson account username
* Dyson account password (this adapter can handle passwords up to 32 characters)
* your fans/air purifiers IP address in your LAN.

*Please note*: Due to early development state and a non conform mDNS implementation by Dyson you'll need to provide the local IP of the device *after the first run*.

*Additional Note*: Since Version 0.7.1 the adapter tries to connect to the device by it's hostname (serialnumber) when no host address/IP ist given. This will work under two prerequisites:
1. There is a DNS Server running in your LAN. Either in your router (e.g. FritzBoxes have a DNS running) or a dedicated one.
2. You haven't changed the default devicename.

> On the first start of this adapter the Dyson API is queried for all your devices and all supported devices will be created in the devicetree -- with their basic information provided by the API and an additional field "Hostaddress".
>
> So please run the adapter once, and your Dyson devices will be created in the device tree with their basic settings.
>
> Then stop the adapter, enter the IP(s) into the Hostaddress field(s) and restart the adapter. After that your Dyson devices in the device tree should be populated with data.

### 2 factor Authentication (since V0.9.0)
After installation of the adapter it should be started automatically - if not please start it first. 
After an update it will also restart automatically. In both cases it will remain in "yellow" state
and probably show some errors in the log - that's fine for now.
* Open the config dialog of the adapter
* At least fill in your eMail address, the password and the country code - the rest is optional  
* Click the 2FA-Code Email button to initiate the process
* You'll receive a "challengeId" automatically in the according field, an eMail and a dialog with further instructions
* enter the 6-digit code from the eMail into the field "dyson one time password"
* Click the "Finish" button
* after that you should have received a token from dyson (invisible for security purposes)
* Click save & close after you have completed your setup - the adapter should start anew and turn green.

All the values will be saved and shown furthermore. 
> Usually you don't need to do this 2 FA on a scheduled basis - but you may repeat it when needed.


## Controlling your device(s)
This adapter is currently able to control the following states of your devices:
* FanSpeed                  , Current fan speed
* Nightmode                 , Night mode state
* Oscillation               , Oscillation of fan.
* ContinuousMonitoring      , Continuous Monitoring of environmental sensors even if device is off.
* MainPower                 , Main Power of fan.
* AutomaticMode             , Fan is in automatic mode.
* Flowdirection             , Direction the fan blows to. ON=Front; OFF=Back (aka Jet focus)
* Jetfocus                  , Direction the fan blows to. ON=Front; OFF=Back (aka Jet focus)
* HeatingMode               , Heating Mode [ON/OFF]
* HeatingTargetTemp         , Target temperature for heating
* AirQualityTarget          , Target air quality for auto mode.
* HumidificationMode        , On / Off
* HumidifyAutoMode          , Auto / Off
* AutoHumidificationTarget  , Auto HumidificationTarget
* HumidificationTarget      , Manual HumidificationTarget
* WaterHardness             , Soft, Medium, Hard

Possible values for these states are documented below, as far as known.
Fan speed only allows values from 1 to 10 and Auto. If you like to set your fan speed down to 0 you'll need to power off the main power.
Which is what the dyson app does also.

### Known issues
* No automatic IP detection of devices
