## reolink adapter for ioBroker

Adapter for ioBroker Plattform to get [Reolink camera](https://reolink.com/) information.

In general all newer Reolink cameras support API commands. They just differ in their supported commands.

One reminder to the password. Try with or without URI encoding, when you have only one special char. Better use no special char and simply a longer password for the same security.

If you wish to have any specific API command included...just let me now.

## Implemented functions
