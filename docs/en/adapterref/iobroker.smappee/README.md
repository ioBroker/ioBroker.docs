An ioBroker adapter for smappee - devices

#### You need to install first ioBroker.MQTT adapter (or use another MQTT-broker) and activate your Smappee's MQTT publishing. Please see the following instructions bevore installing the Smappee adapter.

This adapter brings you realtime (1s-interval) energy  power data, aggregated data for energy and optional sensor consumption data and access to your switches/plugs of your Smappee - Device to ioBroker.

## Instructions

### Installing ioBroker.mqtt - Adapter.

Please add an instance of the ioBroker.mqtt - Adapter:

![ioBMQ](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.smappee/blob/master/admin/ioBrokerMQTTBroker.PNG)

configure the instance as server/broker. Port 1883 as default is ok, feel free to choose any other working.
Set username and password (you will need this for smappee- and smappee-Adapter configuration:

![ioBMC](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.smappee/blob/master/admin/ioBrokerMQTTConfig.PNG)

In the MQTT-Settings tab, the 'Publish only on change' checkbox has to be checked.

### Activation of Smappee's MQTT publishing.

Open your browser and avigate to the URL: <http://X.X.X.X/smappee.html> (replace X.X.X.X by Smappee's IP address in your network).
Click the logon/logoff button and use the password "admin" to Logon.

![smplogon](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.smappee/blob/master/admin/smplogon.png)

Go to the "advanced" section an activate the "Advanced" checkbox in the last field of the table.

![smpadv](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.smappee/blob/master/admin/smpadv.jpeg)

Then you should be here:

![smpmqt](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.smappee/blob/master/admin/smpmqt.png)

Enter your ioBroker´s Ip followed by the port you specified for the mqtt-broker (default is 1883), i.e. tcp://192.168.1.111:1883

Enter username & password you specified configuring your mqtt-broker.
Then hit "Apply changes and restart monitor".

And now it´s time to

### Install the smappee-adapter

Create an instance of the smappee-adapter and enter username & password you specified configuring your mqtt-broker.

If you use other than ioBrokers MQTT-Adapter with default settings, you can optionally specifiy the connection to your MQTT Broker (host & port).

Please give the adapter some minutes to read the data from your smappee device. Reload the object-tree if you're missing some values.

The adapter provides data on actual current, on power consumption in total and for each phase, on the actual load and on state and consumption data for gas, water and switch - sensors.

### Data aggregation or separaion (hourly, daily, yearly,.. values)

Some of smappee's values are 'counters', some are values for a certain period (5-min values).
For aggregation or separation of data, please use the ioBroker.statistics adapter.

### Control plugs/switches

Smappee allows you to remotly control smart plugs / smart switches. Either smappee-ones or other 433Mhz RF-plugs/swiches (i.e. Intertechno IT-1500). Pair the switches with your smappee - app and restart the ioBroker smappee-adapter. You will get the names and states of your plugs and by setting 'switchON' 'true', you turn the switch on, when you set it 'false', you turn it off (when setting 'switchON' ACK has to be false). The actual state of switchON is updated with the state of plug.state.
