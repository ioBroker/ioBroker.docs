# ioBroker.shelly

This is the English documentation - [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German version](../de/protocol-coap.md)

## CoAP (CoIoT)

**CoAP/CoIoT is just supported by Gen1 devices - Plus and Pro devices (Gen2) don't support this protocol!**

**If you are using the firmware versions above 1.9.4, you have to enter a CoIoT server for CoAP on your Shelly device (unicast).**

Enter the IP address of your ioBroker server as CoIoT server, followed by port `5683`. Example: If ioBroker runs on address `192.168.1.2`, you have to enter `192.168.1.2:5683` and activate CoIoT.

**You have to reboot the Shelly device afterward!**

CoAP/CoIoT will add all devices in your network. If you want to exclude some Shelly devices, you can put them on a blacklist. Just enter the serial numbers to the blacklist table:

### Older firmware versions

If you use Shelly devices with firmware version 1.9.4 (or older), you don't have to configure anything. Your Shelly devices will be discovered by ioBroker automatically.

**Important: Because CoAP/CoIoT uses multicast UDP packages, the Shelly devices have to be in the same subnet as your ioBroker server.**

### Important notes

#### Docker

If you use ioBroker in a docker container, the container has to run in network mode `host` or `macvlan`. If the docker container is running in `bridge` mode, your Shelly devices will not be found.

#### Shelly Firmware 1.8.0 (or later)

- If you use the CoAP/CoIoT protocol, you have to use adapter version 4.0.0 or above.
- If you use devices with firmware below 1.8.0 (except Shelly 4 Pro) you have to use adapter version 3.3.6 or below. The adapter version 4.0.0 (or later) would not work in this case!

#### Shelly Firmware 1.9.4 (or later)

- You have to enter a CoAP/CoIoT server for CoAP/CoIoT (unicast).
