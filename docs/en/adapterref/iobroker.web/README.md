Web server on the base of Node.js and express to read the files from ioBroker DB.

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** 
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Tuning Web-Sockets
On some web-sockets clients, there is a performance problem with communication. 
Sometimes this issue is due to the fallback of socket.io communication on a long polling mechanism.
You can set the option *Force Web-Sockets* to force using only web-sockets transport.

## Let's Encrypt Certificates
Read [here](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.admin#lets-encrypt-certificates)

## Extensions
Web driver supports extensions. 
The extension is URL handler, that will be called if such URL request appears.
The extensions look like the normal adapter, but they have no running process 
and will be called by web server.

E.g., the user can activate a special proxy adapter and reach other devices (like webcams) in the same web server.
It is required to let all services be available under one web server.

Web extension could and should support `unload` function, that could return `promise` if the unload action will take some time. 

You can read more about web-extensions [here](WEB-EXTENSIONS-HOWTO.md).

## Brute-force protection
If authentication is enabled and the user enters 5 times invalid password during one minute, he must wait at least one minute till next attempt.
After the 15th wrong attempt, the user must wait 1 hour.

## "Stay logged in" option
If this options is selected, the user stays logged in for one month.
If not, the user will stay logged in for the configured "login timeout".

## Access state's values
You can access the normal state values via the HTTP get request.

```
http://IP:8082/state/system.adapter.web.0.alive =>
{"val":true,"ack":true,"ts":1606831924559,"q":0,"from":"system.adapter.web.0","lc":1606777539894}
```

or access files like:

```
http://IP:8082/vis-2.0/javascript.picture.png =>
[IMAGE]
```

## "Basic Authentication" option
Allows Login via Basic Authentication by sending `401` Unauthorized with a `WWW-Authenticate` header.
This can be used for applications like *FullyBrowser*. When entering the wrong credentials once, you will be redirected 
to the Login Page. 

## User list
You can define the list of users that can access the web server. You can change the access right for logged-in user.

If the user is not in the list, he cannot access the web server.

It is simpler as to set for every object and every state the access rights for the specific user.

## Advanced options
### Default redirect
If by opening of web port im browser no APP selection should be shown, but some specific application, 
the path could be provided here (e.g. `/vis/`) so this path will be opened automatically.

## OAuth2 authentication
The web adapter supports OAuth2 authentication.

To get the tokens, the user must call the URL:

```
http://ip:8082//oauth/token?grant_type=password&username=<user>&password=<password>&client_id=ioBroker&stayloggedin=<false/true>
```

`stayloggedin=true` means that the token will be stored in the browser and will be used for the next requests and is optional.

The answer is like:
```json
{
    "access_token": "21f89e3eee32d3af08a71c1cc44ec72e0e3014a9",
    "expires_in": "2025-02-23T11:39:32.208Z",
    "refresh_token": "66d35faa5d53ca8242cfe57367210e76b7ffded7",
    "refresh_token_expires_in": "2025-03-25T10:39:32.208Z",
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```
