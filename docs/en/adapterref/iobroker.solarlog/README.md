An ioBroker adapter for Solarlog - devices

## Solarlog - Settings

The open JSON-interface (offene Json-Schnittstelle) has to be activated in the Solarlog's configuration menu (Konfiguration - System - Zugangskontrolle - Offene Json-Schnittstelle: aktivieren.)

## Adapter - Settings

### Basic settings

Set Solarlog - IP-address (192.XXX.X.XXX), port (optional) and polling - interval for consumption/production in seconds ('live'- data, min 10s).

Security: you can activate the 'user' - password in your Solarlog and the 'user login activated' checkbox & add your password in the adapter config or you can run Solarlog and adapter without user password. If user-login is activated, it is recommended to stop the adapter while using the solarlog - user interface (otherwise you need to re-login after every request of the adapter).

### Advanced settings

Check if all inverter / submeters / devices / smart energy - data is to be collected.

Set polling - interval for average & sum up values in minutes (min 5min).

Check if historical data is to be collected and set the time of day when the historical data objects will be updated.

Forecast: optionally, the adapter gets forecast - data using the Forecast.Solar API. Actually, the today's and tomorrow's total kWh are predicted, refreshing every hour. More detailed or additional data is available on request (pls open an issue).

## Hardware

Tested on:
Solarlog 200PM+ / 300PM+ / 500 / 1200Meter / 50

SolarLog 50: There is no open JSON-Interface @ SolarLog 50 devices. So certain values in the 'info' and the 'status' channel will be 'ACCESS DENIED'. If you prefer another solution, please open an issue or post your preferences in a corresponding issue.
