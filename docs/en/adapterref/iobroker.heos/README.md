## heos adapter for ioBroker

The adapter lets control HEOS from ioBroker

## Configuration

* **AutoPlay**: Automatically plays music after the player is connected or on unmute. Can be configured globally in configuration. If it is enabled globally you can disable it for one specific player with the state ```auto_play```.
* **Command scope**: Defines to which players the command of ```scope/[cmd]``` is send to. It can be send to all players, all leading players or to all PIDs in the comma separated state: ```heos.0.command_scope_pid```
* **Mute Regex**:
In the configuration you can activate a function to mute the player based on a regex match on the song information. That can be used to mute ads automatically. For example for Spotify you can use the following regex: ```spotify:ad:|Advertisement```.
* **ignore_broadcast_cmd**: This player state configures, if the player should ignore commands to all players e.g. player/set_mute&state=on or pressing the play button for presets/playlists

## Seek
The seek functionality is not working on all sources. Spotify and Amazon Music are supporting seeking.

## Command State

HEOS CLI specification: http://rn.dmglobal.com/euheos/HEOS_CLI_ProtocolSpecification.pdf

### HEOS Command State

* "system/connect": Try to Connect to HEOS
* "system/disconnect": Disconnect from HEOS
* "system/reconnect": Disconnect and Connect
* "system/load_sources": Reload sources
* "system/reboot": Reboot connected player
* "system/reboot_all": Reboot all players
* "group/set_group?pid=<pid1>,<pid2>,...": Set group with the list of player ids e.g. "group/set_group?pid=12345678,12345679".
* "group/set_group?pid=<pid1>" : Delete existing group e.g. "group/set_group?pid=12345678"
* "group/ungroup_all" : Delete all groups
* "group/group_all" : Group all player in one group
* "player/[cmd]": Send the command to all players. e.g. player/set_mute&state=on 
* "leader/[cmd]": Send the command to all leading players. e.g. leader/set_mute&state=on
* "scope/[cmd]": Send the command to the configured scope all players, leading players or comma separated player pids in scope_pids
* "...": All other commands are tried to send to HEOS

### Player Command State

Note: Multiple commands are possible, if they are separated with the pipe e.g. set_volume&level=20|play_preset&preset=1

* "set_volume&level=0|1|..|100": Set the player volume 
* "set_play_state&state=play|pause|stop": Set the player state
* "set_play_mode&repeat=on_all|on_one|off&shuffle=on|off": Set Repeat and Shuffle mode
* "set_mute&state=on|off": Mute player
* "volume_down&step=1..10": Lower volume
* "volume_up&step=1..10": Raise volume
* "play_next": Play next
* "play_previous": Play previous
* "play_preset&preset=1|2|..|n": Play preset n
* "play_stream&url=url_path": Play URL-Stream
* "add_to_queue&sid=1025&aid=4&cid=[CID]": Play playlist with [CID] on player (aid: 1 – play now; 2 – play next; 3 – add to end; 4 – replace and play)

## Image color extraction
With version 1.7.6 the prominent colors of the song cover are extracted and saved to three new player states:
* **current_image_color_palette**: Prominent colors selected by node-vibrant.
* **current_image_color_background**: Color with the biggest population in the image. Can be used as background color for player controls in VIS.
* **current_image_color_foreground**: Color with the second biggest population in the image and a good read contrast to the background color. Can be used as text color for player controls in VIS.

- Playlists: ```heos.0.sources.1025.browse```
