## Requirements

-   NodeJS >= 12.x
-   ioBroker >= 3.x, with admin >= 5.x
-   Gigaset Elements system

## Installation

Until the adapter is part of the latest or stable repository, you can install the latest version by enabling expert mode in ioBroker and install the adapter from npm or github.

After installation, create a new instance and configure the settings:

-   Connection Settings for accessing Gigaset Elements cloud
    -   email
    -   password
    -   authentication interval, should be 6 (hours)
-   Polling intervals for different areas
    -   events (i.e. window/door open/tilt/close) - number of seconds between polling
    -   element/sensor data (i.e. temperature, humidity) - number of minutes between polling

## Limitations

The adapter currently only reads data and does not allow to change anything.

### Supported Elements

So far, the adapter has been tested/is known to work with the following Elements, and test data is available via [gigaset-elements-api](https://github.com/matthsc/gigaset-elements-api):

| Element type | Element name          | Tested by |
| ------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| is01         | Siren                 | matthsc   |
| um01         | Universal/Window/Door | matthsc   |
| wd01         | Water                 | matthsc   |

If you have other elements, or encounter event types that are not yet handled by the adapter, you can enable expert mode in ioBroker, go to the _Debug_ tab in the adapter settings (only visible with expert mode), and use "Debug - Prepare test data" to generate test data that can be submitted as part of a github issue for this adapter to get the additional elements/event types included. Personal data like basestation or element names and ids are stripped from the generated data as far as possible.

## Messages

So far, the adapter only supports messages used for testing/debugging.

### Testing

Callback responses are either <code>{ response: "&lt;message&gt;" }</code> if the action was sucessfull, or <code>{ error: "&lt;error message&gt;" }</code> in case something went wrong.

#### Ping

Send a ping to the adapter, and receive a <code>{ response: "pong" }</code>.

```ts
sendTo("gigaset-elements.0", "test", "ping", callback);
```

#### Process test data

Process test data from [gigaset-elements-api](https://github.com/matthsc/gigaset-elements-api). Creates base stations, elements, and processes captured test events.

```ts
sendTo("gigaset-elements.0", "test", "process-test-data", callback);
```

### Debugging

Callback responses are either <code>{ response: object }</code> if the action was sucessfull, or <code>{ error: "&lt;error message&gt;" }</code> in case something went wrong.

#### Prepare test data

Load current data from the Gigaset Elements API and prepare it to be integrated as test data into [gigaset-elements-api](https://github.com/matthsc/gigaset-elements-api), i.e. for new events or elements that have no test data yet.

Loads basestations, elements and events from the API, reduces it to minimize the amount of data, and tries to strip personal information like names and ids from the data.

Returns the data as an <code>{ response: { bs: [], elements: [], events: [] } }</code> object.

```ts
sendTo("gigaset-elements.0", "debug", { action: "prepare-test-data" from?: Date }, callback);
```

#### Load base station and element data

Loads and returns the raw basestation and elements data as an <code>{ response: { bs: [], elements: []} }</code> object.

```ts
sendTo("gigaset-elements.0", "test", { action: "load-bases-elements" }, callback);
```

#### Load events

Loads events and returns an <code>{ response: { events: [] } }</code> object.

Event data is usually available for 1 month, older data seems not to be available.

```ts
sendTo("gigaset-elements.0", "test", { action: "load-events", from: Date, to: Date }, callback);
```
