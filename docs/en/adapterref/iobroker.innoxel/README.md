## Requirements

- NodeJS >= 20.x
- ioBroker >= 6.0.11, with admin >= 6.x
- Innoxel Master 3 Smart Home system

## Installation

Until the adapter is part of the stable repository, you can install the latest version by enabling expert mode in ioBroker and install the adapter from npm. Don't install it directly from Github, this will lead to an error on adapter start ("cannot find start file").

The adapter can be installed straigt from the stable/beta repositories. After installation, create a new instance and configure the settings:

- Connection Settings for accessing innoxel master
  - ip address
  - port
  - username
  - password
- Polling intervals for different areas
  - state changes (i.e. switches, dimmer)
  - room climate / thermostats
  - weather
  - innoxel master device details (requires admin privileges for the user connecting to innoxel master)

Please note: Don't install the adapter directly from Github, this will lead to an error on adapter start ("cannot find start file").

## Supported Modules and Firmware

A pre-release version of this adapter has been working for more than 2 years with firmware 1.4.1.0 and then 1.5.1.0.

The initially released version has been tested with firmware 1.6.0.0.

The following modules have been tested/are supported:

- Innoxel Master 3
- Switch 8 G1
- Motor 4 x 230 VAC G1
- Dim 4 x 600 VA
- Taster RGB

If it works for you with different modules, or you have other modules that don't work, please feel free to open an issue.

## Messages

The adapter supports the messages described in the following sections.

### triggerInModule

Simulate pressing of a button on a "Taster".

```ts
sendTo("innoxel.0", "triggerInModule", "<moduleId>:<channelId>", callback);

// i.e. to trigger button 1 on "Taster" with id/address 20
sendTo("innoxel.0", "triggerInModule", "20:1");
sendTo("innoxel.0", "triggerInModule", "20:1", () => {
  // do something after the button press has been executed
});
```

- <code>moduleId</code> is the id/address of the "Taster"
- <code>channelId</code> is the index of the button on the "Taster"
- <code>callback</code> (optional) callback function to call when action has been performed

### setDimValue

Simulate pressing of a button on a "Taster".

```ts
sendTo(
  "innoxel.0",
  "setDimValue",
  "<moduleId>:<channelId>:<dimValue>:<dimSpeed>",
  callback
);

// i.e. to set the value of channel 7 on dim module 1 to 80%
sendTo("innoxel.0", "setDimValue", "1:7:80");
sendTo("innoxel.0", "setDimValue", "1:7:80", () => {
  // do something after value has been set
});
```

- <code>moduleId</code> is the id/address of the dimmer module
- <code>channelId</code> is channel of the dimmer on the module
- <code>dimValue</code> is the value in percent to set (0-100)
- <code>dimSpeed</code> (optional) is the dimming speed to use (0-15)
- <code>callback</code> (optional) callback function to call when action has been performed

### setTemperature

Set heating or cooling temperature.

```ts
sendTo(
  "innoxel.0",
  "setTemperature",
  "<moduleId>:<temperatureType>:<temperature>",
  callback
);

// i.e. to set setTemperatureHeating to 20° on room climate module 0
sendTo("innoxel.0", "setTemperature", "1:setTemperature:20");
sendTo("innoxel.0", "setTemperature", "1:setTemperature:20", () => {
  // do something after the button press has been executed
});
```

- <code>moduleId</code> is the id/address room climate module
- <code>temperatureType</code> is the temperature type to set (absenceSetbackTemperatureCooling, absenceSetbackTemperatureHeating, nightSetbackTemperatureCooling, nightSetbackTemperatureHeating, setTemperatureCooling, setTemperatureHeating, )
- <code>temperature</code> temperature to set, in 0.5° steps. There's also a min/max value depending on type
- <code>callback</code> (optional) callback function to call when action has been performed
