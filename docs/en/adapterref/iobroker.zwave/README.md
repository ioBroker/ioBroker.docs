Zwave support with openzwave.

For this adapter is used rather good supported npm module: https://github.com/OpenZWave/node-openzwave-shared
You should find out what the name has USB port of the Z-Wave stick and setup it in the adapter settings.

## Important Information
- On first run, the Adapter needs some time, to calculate all Objects within iobroker.
- If you add a Device, let the adapter do it's job and wait a little bit.
- If a Device is not visible within the included Admistration Site, it's not fully imported into ioBroker.

## Installation
First of all, Implementation is tested only on ARM Linux (e.g. Raspberry Pi (2)).
You need a fully Development Environment (gcc, make,...)

### Install additional packages
On some systems it will be necessary to install additional packages. Therefore run the following on the console before installing the adapter:
```bash
apt-get install pkg-config libudev-dev build-essential curl unzip
```

### Raspberry Pi3 only: Activate GPIO UART
On Raspberry Pi 3, the UART is by default occupied by the bluetooth module. To activate it for use with a GPIO module, follow these steps:

1. `sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt`
	1. remove `console=serial0,115200`
	1. save the file and close it

2. `sudo nano /boot/config.txt`  
Look for each of the following lines. If they are commented out with a `#`, remove that. If they don't exist, add them to the end of the file:
	* `dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt`
	* `enable_uart=1`
	* `force_turbo=1`

3. reboot

### First start
The GPIO module usually has an address like `/dev/ttyAMA0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`.
The USB stick can be found under `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyUSB1`.

- Go into iobroker admin and add the Zwave Adapter (the installation is rather long, be patient)
- Start the new zwave Adapter instance and select the controller device's address from the dropdown in the admin UI.
- If your device is not detected, check it or try to manually enter its address when the adapter is turned off.
- Wait until the indicator in the "Instances" tab turns green or the message "zwave.0 Scan completed" is found in the iobroker log.

### Known issues
If you get the following (or similar) error after starting the adapter
```
libopenzwave.so.1.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

you can fix it by running
```
sudo ldconfig
```
or
```
sudo ldconfig /usr/local
```
or
```
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib64
```

If all of those commands don't work, the following process might:
1. `sudo nano /etc/ld.so.conf.d/zwave.conf`
	1. enter `/usr/local/lib64`
	1. quit the editor with `CTRL+X`, confirm with `Y` to save the changes
	
1. `sudo ldconfig`

## Configuration
Within Admin Settings you can set following Attributes

- USB name (the USB Port of your Z-Wave stick)
- Logging (enable logging to OZW_Log.txt)
- Console Output (copy logging to the console, Logs all to ioBroker.log)
- Save Config (write an XML network layout create a /zwcfg_<HOMEID>.xml on linux)
- Driver Attempts (try this many times before giving up)
- Poll Interval (interval between polls in milliseconds)
- Suppress Refresh (do not send updates if nothing changed)

## Logfiles / Configuration Settings
If you have installed iobroker into default Folder:

 - Logfile: /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.zwave/node_modules/openzwave-shared/OZW_Log.txt on linux
 - Configuration: /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.zwave/node_modules/zwcfg_<HOMEID>.xml on linux

## Device add or remove
If you add or remove a device, it takes 60 seconds. Then the page is automatically reloaded.

If you change the Name or Location, it takes 5 seconds. Then the page is automatically reloaded.

## Features
Within OpenZWave Configurator you can see all Nodes and their classes.

Following Actions are current supported (only with context menu):

- Set Name and Set Location for Node itself
- Change Value of a class

Following global Actions are current supported:

- Add Nodes
- Remove Nodes
- Refresh Nodes (Refresh Nodes from ioBroker Communication)
