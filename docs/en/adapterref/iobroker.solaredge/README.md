## Sentry
**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.**
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Solaredge Adapter for ioBroker 

Get data from solaredge monitoring portal.
Currently, only the /overview data point is used to get the current power and day/month/year/lifetime energy readings.

You can also enable modbus on your solaredge device if it's a newer one and read the data directly. 

You need your site id and api key to use this adapter. To get these, go to https://monitoring.solaredge.com  
- site id: log in, site id is the "ID" on the right, e.g., 12345.  
- api key: log in, go to the admin settings and enable api access there. If you don't see admin settings, send mail to solaredge to enable admin for your account.


## Credits

This adapter would not have been possible without the great work of @92lleo (https://github.com/92lleo), who wrote the code for the initial versions and released it to ioborker-community-adapters.
