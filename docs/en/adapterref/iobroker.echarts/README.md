## echarts adapter for ioBroker
Build useful charts in ioBroker:

## Usage
Add after the restart the tab in the admin:
![Admin](img/admin.png)

The created preset can be accessed in web adapter too. URL: `http://IP:8082/echarts/index.html?preset=echarts.0.PRESETID`.

For vis there is a special widget with easy selection of presets.  

### Tooltip
Lower case `i` indicates that the value was interpolated from the 2 neighbour values, and it does not exist at this time stamp.

### Server side rendering
You can render the presets on the server and get it as base64 URL or save it on disk on in ioBroker DB:

```
sendTo('echarts.0', {
    preset:   'echarts.0.myPreset', // the only mandatory attribute

    renderer: 'svg',                // svg | png | jpg | pdf, default: svg

    width: 1024,                    // default 1024
    height: 300,                    // default 300
    background: '#000000',          // Background color
    theme: 'light',                 // Theme type: 'light', 'dark'

    title: 'ioBroker Chart',        // Title of PDF document 
    quality: 0.8,                   // quality of JPG
    compressionLevel: 3,            // Compression level of PNG
    filters: 8,                     // Filters of PNG (Bit combination https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/blob/master/types/index.d.ts#L10)

    fileOnDisk: '',                 // Path on disk to save the file. 
    fileName: '',                   // Path in ioBroker DB to save the files on 'echarts.0'. E.g. if your set "chart.svg", so you can access your picture via http(s)://ip:8082/echarts.0/chart.png
}, result => {
    if (result.error) {
        console.error(result.error);
    } else {
        console.log(result.data);
    }
});
```
