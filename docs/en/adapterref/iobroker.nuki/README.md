This ioBroker adapter allows to control and monitor the [Nuki Smart Lock](https://nuki.io/de/) by using the API of the Nuki Bridge.

## Requirements
* A Nuki (hardware or software) Bridge.
* A Nuki Smart Lock and/or a Nuki Opener.
* A running instance of ioBroker.

## Usage
Each instance of the Nuki adapter represents a Nuki bridge. When creating an instance, simply enter IP address, port and token of your Nuki bridge. The name is optional and will be generated automatically if left empty. The checkbox "use callback" and the value "callback port in ioBroker" are optional and can be set in order to make use of the callback function of the Nuki. After saving an instance there will be created a bridge device with a channel for each Nuki lock that is connected to the specified Nuki bridge. The channels provide the current state of the Nuki lock as output parameters:

* batteryCritical: Indicator for low battery
* deviceType: Type of Nuki device (Smart Lock or Opener)
* mode: Operation mode of the Nuki device
* doorState: Current (numeric) doorsensor state (Nuki native)
* lockState: Indicator whether Nuki is locked (Nuki Smart Lock only)
* state: Current (numeric) lock state (Nuki native)
* timestamp: Last updated

Additionally, the channels provide input parameters which enable basic control of the Nuki lock:

* action: Numeric action code for setting the Nuki state (Nuki native)

Valid input values for locks are:

    0 (no action)
    1 (unlock)
    2 (lock)
    3 (unlatch)
    4 (lock ‘n’ go)
    5 (lock ‘n’ go with unlatch)

* lockAction: Switch for locking / unlocking the Nuki (true = unlock; false = lock)
* openAction: Button for unlatching the Nuki
* openLocknGoAction: Button for unlatching and after some seconds locking the Nuki
* unlockLocknGoAction: Button for unlocking and after some seconds locking the Nuki

Valid input values for openers are:

    0 (no action)
    1 (activate rto)
    2 (deactivate rto)
    3 (electric strike actuation)
    4 (activate continuous mode)
    5 (deactivate continuous mode)

* rtoAction: Switch for activating / deactivating the Ring to Open function (true = activate; false = deactivate)
* openAction: Button for electric strike actuation
* cmActiveAction: Button for activating the Continous Mode
* cmDeactiveAction: Button for deactivating the Continous Mode

## Additional information
How to get your bridges token:

* Call http://< bridge_ip >:< bridge_port >/auth from any browser in your LAN -> bridge turns on its LED
* Press the button of the bridge within 30 seconds
* Result of the browser call should be something like this:
    {
    "token": “token123”,
    "success": true
    }
Callback function:

If the callback function is being used, the adapter will try to automatically set the callback on the Nuki bridge when the instance is being saved. When the instance is unloaded the callback will be deleted again. All Nuki states will be kept up-to-date by the Nuki bridge while callback is activated.
Callbacks can be set and removed from any browser with following urls:

Set:
* http://< bridge_ip >:< bridge_port >/callback/add?url=http%3A%2F%2F< host_ip >%3A< host_port >%2Fapi%2Fnuki&token=< bridgeToken >

Remove:
* http://< bridge_ip >:< bridge_port >/callback/remove?id=< callback_id >&token=< bridgeToken >

## Update
When updating from 1.0.x to 1.1.0 or higher it is recommended to delete all instances of the old version before installing the new version. Please be aware that version changes bigger than on patch level (-> change of only the last digit) could always contain changes to data points e.g. 1.1.2 to 1.1.4
