## tesla motors adapter for ioBroker

This Adapter adds control over your tesla car to ioBroker.

## Configuration
1. Create a new instance of the adapter, each car needs its own instance.
2. Select your prefered refresh Rate (See [Refresh Rate](#refreshRate))
2. Enter your Tesla Username and Tesla Password. 
3. Click "get Token" to request a Token and a Refresh Token from Tesla.
4. Choose your car in the dropdown.

### <a name="refreshRate"></a>Refresh Rate
To save battery, the car goes to sleep mode afer a certain time of no activity.<br />
Getting information from the car can only be done when the car is awake.<br />
Users reported, that the car can consume up to 10km of Range per day if it does not go to sleep state.<br />
To prevent from that, you can choose your desired Refresh Rate:
* **Off** - The adapter does not wake up the car on its own. It only wakes up the car upon request (If you set a State).
<br />If the car woke up on its own, the adapter will request car data once.
* **Temperate** - The Adapter will wake up the car once per hour to get his state.
* **Aggressive** - The Adapter will wake up the car once per minute.
* **Smart** - The Adapter tries to be smart. It will observe the car sleep state. When the car wakes up,
it assumes that someone might be driving soon and requests the state every minute for 10 minutes.
If nothing happend (no Climate, no Driving, no Charging) the adapter stops requesting for 15 minutes
to let the car fall asleep. In any case, it will wake up the car and get data after 12 hours.

## Using the adapter
The Adapter creates several states. The are group by their topics:
* **chargeState** - about charging, battery and range.
* **climateState** - Temperatures and window states.
* **driveState** - Position and speed
* **softwareUpdate** - Information about pending software updates
* **vehicle** - Information about your vehicle

There is a special group called **command** where you can find all commands to control your car.
Some of them are working both ways, for example the climate state will change when 
climate is turned off by the car. You can see this in the "Send / Recieve" column.

## Security &amp; Credentials
The Tesla API uses a Token-Based security approach.<br />
The Token will expire (currently after 45 days) but the system can retrieve a new Token using the 
Refresh Token.<br />
Your credentials do not have to be stored for the Adapter to work, but if you are getting problems 
with refreshing the token this could make it more stable as the adapter can get a complete new token any time.<br />
<aside class="warning">
Warning:<br />
With your Tesla credentials you can control the while car including open Windows and even driving around. 
Keep your credentials save! <br />To reject all Tokens, change your Tesla account Password!
