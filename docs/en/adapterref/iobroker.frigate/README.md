## Changelog

<!--
    Placeholder for the next version (at the beginning of the line):
  ### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
-->
### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
- (Eistee82) Fixed zone object counters (e.g. `<zone>.person`) staying at their last value after the object left the zone. Per-zone object counts are now sourced solely from the Frigate MQTT occupancy topics, and the zone aggregator resets its active/stationary states to 0 and uses `current_zones` instead of the cumulative `entered_zones`.

### 3.0.3 (2026-06-09)
- (@GermanBluefox) Added button to re-create the docker container

### 3.0.2 (2026-05-30)
- (@GermanBluefox) Replaced the track of objects with drop down menu

### 3.0.0 (2026-05-16)

- (copilot) Added re-streaming support for live video feeds (experimental)
