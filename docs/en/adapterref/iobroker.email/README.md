Send emails from ioBroker. You cannot check emails with this adapter, only send them.

The adapter uses [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) to provide the functionality.

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Email Provider Specific Notes

### Gmail
**Important:** If you have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled on your Gmail account, you **must** use an App Password instead of your regular Gmail password. This has always been required by nodemailer for Gmail with 2FA.

To set up Gmail with 2FA:
1. Enable 2-Step Verification in your Google Account settings
2. Generate an App Password specifically for ioBroker email adapter
3. Use your Gmail address as username and the generated App Password as password in the adapter configuration

For accounts without 2FA, you may need to configure "Allow Less Secure Apps" in your Gmail account settings. You also may need to unlock your account with "Allow access to your Google account" to use SMTP.

### mail.ee
For mail.ee email service, **do not** use your normal webmail login credentials. Instead:

- **Username**: Use your complete email address (e.g., `username@mail.ee`)
- **Password**: Use the special IMAP/SMTP password (not your webmail password)
  - To find your IMAP/SMTP password: Log into your mail.ee webmail account and visit [https://posti.mail.ee/prefs?group=enable_pop3](https://posti.mail.ee/prefs?group=enable_pop3)

## Usage

To send email from ScriptEngine just write:

```js
// send email to all instances of email adapter
sendTo('email', 'Email body');

// send email to specific instance of email adapter
sendTo("email.1", 'Email body');

// To specify subject or other options
sendTo('email', {
    from:    'iobroker@mydomain.com',
    to:      'aabbcc@gmail.com, xxyyzz@gmail.com', // comma separated multiple recipients.
    subject: 'Message from ioBroker',
    text:    'This is test email to you!',
});

// To send attachments
sendTo('email', {
    attachments: [
        {
            path: '/pathToImage/picture1.jpg', // use file on disk as attachment
        },
        {
            filename: 'license.txt',
            path: 'https://raw.github.com/andris9/Nodemailer/master/LICENSE', // use URL as an attachment
        },
    ]
});

// To send in html format
sendTo('email', {
    html: '<p>Embedded image: <img src='cid:image1'/></p>',
    attachments:[
        {
            path: 'path/to/file/image1.jpg',
            cid: 'image1',
        },
    ]
});
```

To send email from another adapter, use `adapter.sendTo` function.
