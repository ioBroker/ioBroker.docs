Send emails from ioBroker.

The adapter uses [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) to provide the functionality.

**This Adapter requires nodejs 6.x or higher!!**

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

To use Gmail you may need to configure "Allow Less Secure Apps" in your Gmail account unless you are using 2FA in which
case you would have to create an Application Specific password. You also may need to unlock your account with "Allow access to your Google account" to use SMTP.

## Usage

To send email from ScriptEngine just write:

```
// send email to all instances of email adapter
sendTo("email", "Email body");

// send email to specific instance of email adapter
sendTo("email.1", "Email body");

// To specify subject or other options
sendTo("email", {
    from:    "iobroker@mydomain.com",
    to:      "aabbcc@gmail.com, xxyyzz@gmail.com", // comma separated multiple recipients.
    subject: "Message from ioBroker",
    text:    "This is test email to you!"
});

// To send attachments
sendTo("email", {
    attachments: [
       // use file on disk as attachment
       {path: "/pathToImage/picture1.jpg"},
       {   // use URL as an attachment
            filename: 'license.txt',
            path: 'https://raw.github.com/andris9/Nodemailer/master/LICENSE'
       }
    ]
});

// To send in html format
sendTo("email", {
    html: "<p>Embedded image: <img src='cid:image1'/></p>",
    attachments:[
        {path: "path/to/file/image1.jpg", cid: "image1"}
    ]
});
```

To send email from other adapter use **adapter.sendTo** function.
