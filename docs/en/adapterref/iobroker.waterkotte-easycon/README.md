## waterkotte-easycon adapter for ioBroker

Read and write parameters of Waterkotte EasyCon heat pumps via CGI requests. Tested with [Waterkotte EcoTouch Ai1 Geo](https://www.waterkotte.de/waermepumpen/ecotouch-ai1-geo-erdwaermepumpe-6-18kw) (2017 model).

## Features

### Implemented

-   automatic reading of values from heat pump dependending on the used functions (water, heating, cooling, photovoltaics, solar, ...)

### Planned

-   notify on heat pump alarms
-   write values
-   read and manage schedules
-   SG-ready like control of target values

## Usage

### Installation

Install the adapter `waterkotte-easycon` from the ioBroker repository.

### Connection to heat pump

There are two RJ45 ports on the bottom side of the touch panel. They can be accessed by removing the front cover of the heat pump using the provided tool. Looking upwards from below connect the ethernet cable to the right port.

Check your router to find out the IP address of the heat pump and enable static IP address so that the heat pump address will not change.

### Configuration

| Parameter                       | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IP address                      | IP address of the heat pump (see [Connection to heat pump](#Connection-to-heat-pump)) |
| Username                        | Default `waterkotte`                                                                  |
| Password                        | Default `waterkotte`                                                                  |
| Update interval                 | Frequency of updating the values in milliseconds (Default: 300 seconds = 5 minutes)   |
| Remove whitespace from state ID | If `State format` is `Path + Description` all whitespaces will be replaced by `_`     |

#### State format

| Value         | Beschreibung                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Path + ID`   | All state names will use the tag id, e.g. `Heating.A32` where `A32` is the internal id of the tag `Target temperatur` of the floor heating                                          |
| `Path + Name` | All state names will use the name of the tag, e.g. `Heating.Target value`. Enable `Remove whitespace from state ID` to avoid whitespaces in state ids (e.g. `Heating.Target_value`) |

> Changing `State format` or `Remove whitespace from state ID` will delete all states of the instance and create the new structure.
