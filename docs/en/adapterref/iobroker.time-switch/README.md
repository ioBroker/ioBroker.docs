## time-switch adapter for ioBroker

This adapter allows the user to switch devices on and off using time schedules. 
The schedules can be fully configured by a vis widget.
One schedule switches one or more ioBroker states and consists of one or more triggers that define when and how the state should be switched. 
It is possible to configure at which time and on which weekdays the trigger should be triggered. Astro triggers can also be created.
There can be custom on/off values also.
In the widget the schedule can be disabled temporarily and the switched state can be controlled manually.
