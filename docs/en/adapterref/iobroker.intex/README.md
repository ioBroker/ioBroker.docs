## intex adapter for ioBroker

Adapter for Intex Whirlpool with wifi modul

## The strategy how to communicate with the pool and the cloud

### About clouds

#### Cloud secondary; Pool locally if available

In this mode, the system attempts to issue the control command and update command locally. If there is an error in local communication, the system switches to cloud operation until the adapter is started again.

IP address and port come from the cloud. If the IP address is the same, the pool must be registered again in the app. Long press the connect button and search the pool. Deleting it from the app is usually not necessary.

#### Cloud secondary; Pool only local

In this mode, the system issues the control command and update command locally. If there is an error in local communication, the system does not switch to cloud operation.

The interval can be set to 0.5 minutes here.

IP address and port come from the cloud. If the IP address is the same, the pool must be registered again in the app. Long press the connect button and search the pool. Deleting it from the app is usually not necessary.

#### Cloud only

In this mode, the system only sends the control command and update command via the cloud.

##### Login

Enter the Intex app mail and password.

### Local

#### Local only

In local operation, functions are currently also offered that the pool does not support. Either the DNS name of the pool on the router or the IP address of the pool must be specified under Address.

The interval can also be set to 0.5 minutes here.

The IP address of the pool can be searched for using the search button. However, this can be prevented by routers if e.g. B. WLAN devices are not allowed to communicate with each other or ports or on-board casting are blocked in the local firewall of the computer.

## Controlling the functions of the spa

"intex.0.-id-.control.-command-" set to true or false controls the pool command's state.
