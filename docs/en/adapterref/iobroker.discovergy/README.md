# ioBroker.discovergy

This is an ioBroker adapter for your Discovergy Power measurement meter.
It uses the Discovergy API to read data of your meters and synchronise it's current values to ioBroker.

https://api.discovergy.com/docs/

Please feel free to add issue for your wanted functionality or problems you see so i can take a look at it !

Remark : I don't have all possible devices and also the demo-account does not provide all existing values devices can provide.
If you receive the following error :

				Information received from Discovergy which is not yet part of this adapter"
				"Send this information to developer : xxxxx

Please go to your logfile and download it, create an issue here on github with the provided values.
Do not copy-paste from Admin webinterface, information is missing here which i need !

You can test this adapter by using the demo credentials of discovergy (or with your own :-)):
username = demo@discovergy.com
pass = demo
