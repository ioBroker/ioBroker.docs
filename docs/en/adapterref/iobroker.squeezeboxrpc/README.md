This is an alternative Adapter that uses the JSON/RPC-Protokoll to get data and send commands to the Logitech Media Server ([LMS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logitech_Media_Server))
for controlling connected devices like 
* native [squeezebox](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezebox), 
* raspberry pi with additional audio module and small linux based firmwares like [picoreplayer](https://picoreplayer.org/) or [max2play](https://www.max2play.com).
* with plugins chromecast, airplay or UPnP/DLNA-Devices

The LMS-Server can manage/provide very big music collections on harddrives or NAS, connect to different streaming providers like Spotify, Deezer, Soundcloud, shoutcast, tunein, napster, pandora, tidal and more

Why another squeezebox adapter?

The existing adapter use telnet to access the LMS. The telnet has some disadvantages.
The actual main web interface of the LMS also uses the rpc/json-protocol to get all needed informations or send commands to the server/players.

## Features

- most of data that the LMS-Service provides is available in the adapter
- detailed information about the player status, song title, artist, album, artwork, playlist
- many control features to play, pause, stop, forward, rewind, repeat, shuffle, play favorite, jump to time (absolute and relative) , jump to playlist index (absolute and relative), power on/off and preset buttons
- all favorites and all sub levels from server
- many widgets for the iobroker-vis component are included to create own control user interfaces (select player,select favorites, manage syncgroups, buttons for play/pause,fwd,rew, repeat mode and shuffle mode selection)

Documentation for the vis-widgets are available inside vis or [Widget-Documentation/german](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/oweitman/ioBroker.squeezeboxrpc/blob/master/widgets/squeezeboxrpc/doc.html)


## Installation

- Install the package
- Create an instance
- Configure the Instance with the IP of the logitech media server and the port (normaly 9000)
- start/restart the instance

## Update

- after changes in the widget code and upadte of the adapter, iobroker should upload webfiles to the internal webserver. user reported that this sometimes didnt happend or only with delay. you can trigger this action with the following command

iobroker upload squeezeboxpc
