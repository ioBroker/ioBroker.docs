**Tests:** ![Test and Release](https://github.com/oweitman/ioBroker.squeezeboxrpc/workflows/Test%20and%20Release/badge.svg)

This is an alternative Adapter that uses the `JSON/RPC`-protocol to get data
and send commands to the Logitech Media Server ([LMS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logitech_Media_Server))
for controlling connected devices like

- native [squeezebox](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezebox),
- raspberry pi with additional audio module and small linux based firmwares
  like [picoreplayer](https://picoreplayer.org/) or [max2play](https://www.max2play.com).
- with plugins chromecast, airplay or `UPnP/DLNA`-Devices

The `LMS`-Server can manage/provide very big music collections on harddrives
or `NAS`, connect to different streaming providers like `Spotify`, `Deezer`,
`Soundcloud`, `shoutcast`, `tunein`, `napster`, `pandora`, `tidal` and more

Why another `Squeezebox` adapter?

The existing adapter use `telnet` to access the `LMS`. The telnet has some disadvantages.
The actual main web interface of the `LMS` also uses the rpc/json-protocol to get
all needed informations or send commands to the server/players.

## Features

- most of [data](#server) that the `LMS`-Service provides is available in the adapter
- detailed [information](#players) about the player status, song title, artist,
  album, artwork, playlist
- [many control features](#provided-states) to play, pause, stop, forward,\
   rewind, repeat, shuffle, play favorite, jump to time\
   (absolute and relative) , jump to playlist index (absolute and relative),\
   power on/off and preset buttons
- all [favorites](#favorites) and all sub levels from server
- many [widgets](#widgets) for the iobroker-vis component are included to\
   create own
  control user interfaces (select player,select favorites, manage syncgroups,
  buttons for play/pause,fwd,rew, repeat mode and shuffle mode selection)

## Installation

- Install the package
- Create an instance
- Configure the Instance with the IP of the logitech media server
  and the port (normaly 9000)
- start/restart the instance

## Update

- After installation or update, it may sometimes be necessary\
   to execute the following command if problems have arisen in vis-1
