or any associated subsidiaries, logos or trademarks.

## Widget
From version 1.8.0 on, the adapter comes with a vis widget. The widget only works with the port 8080 API.
![Widget](/docs/en/media/widgetPreview.png)

## Installation
You can either install the adapter via the ioBroker web interface or on your local machine via npm.

### Browser-based
1. Open your ioBroker web interface in a browser (eg: 192.168.30.70:8081)
2. Click on Tab "Adapters"
3. Type "sonnen" in the filter
4. Click on the three points and then on the "+" symbol of the sonnen adapter<br/>
![Add Adapter](/docs/en/media/addInstance.png)

### Local machine
Navigate into your iobroker folder and execute the following command: 
```bash
npm i iobroker.sonnen
```

## Setup
Additional to the adapter installation you have to add an instance of the adapter.

### ioBroker 
1. Open your ioBroker interface in a browser (eg: 192.168.1.33:8081)
2. Navigate to Tab "Adapters"
3. Click on the three points and then on the "+" symbol of the sonnen adapter
![Add Adapter](/docs/en/media/addInstance.png)
4. Now you can see the main settings of the adapter configuration page --> type in the ip-address of your sonnen battery.
__It is also strongly recommended, to provide an API key, which can be found in the webinterface of your sonnen battery (Tab: Software Integration). Otherwise, the adapter uses the unofficial API.__
![Main Settings](/docs/en/media/mainSettings.png)
5. If you want to thange the interval in which the states are polled, click on the tab "Advanced Settings"
6. You can set the poll interval between 2000 ms (2 seconds) and 60000 ms (1 minute), the default value is 7 seconds
![Advanced Settings](/docs/en/media/advancedSettings.png)
7. Click on Save & Close

## Usage
Here you can find a description of the states and how to use them. The most states of this adapter are read-only states.
Note, that there are two different sonnen API's so if you are missing states, they are probably not supported.

### States
Note: The old and legacy API states (API port 3480/7979) are currently not or only partially documented

#### Channel: powermeter
This channel has two subchannels, e.g. `4_1` and `4_2` where one represents consumption and the other one production.
 
The both channels have the identical states. All states are read-only numbers.

### Channel: inverter
The channel consists of read-only states of type `number`, providing information about the inverter of your battery.
