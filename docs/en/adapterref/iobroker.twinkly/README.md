## twinkly adapter for ioBroker

Adapter to communicate with the [Twinkly lights](https://www.twinkly.com/).

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

### Upload Movie
```
sendTo('twinkly.0', 'uploadMovie', {
    connection : 'Fenster',
    frames     : [
        [{"r":18,"g":105,"b":58},{"r":18,"g":105,"b":58}, ...],
        [{"r":18,"g":105,"b":58},{"r":18,"g":105,"b":58}, ...],
        ...
    ],
    delay : 250
});
```

    template   : 1
});

```
### Upload Twinkle Movie
```
sendTo('twinkly.0', 'uploadTwinkleMovie', {
    connection  : 'Fenster',
    baseColor   : '#00873f', // or {r: 0, g: 135, b: 62}
    secondColor : '#c30F15'  // or {r: 195, g: 15, b: 22}
});
```

<!--
### Send Realtime Frame
```
sendTo('twinkly.0', 'sendrealtimeframe', {
    connection : 'Fenster',
    frame      : [{"r":221,"g":0,"b":85},{"r":221,"g":0,"b":85}, ...]
});
```
-->

### Generate Frame in a specific color
Returns a full frame in one color.
By sending the colors in the property `colors` you get an array of frames returned.
```
sendTo('twinkly.0', 'generateFrame', {
    connection : 'Fenster',
    color      : '#12693a' // or {"r": 18,"g":105,"b":58}
});
response => {
    // [{"r":18,"g":105,"b":58},{"r":18,"g":105,"b":58}, ...]
    ...
}

sendTo('twinkly.0', 'generateFrame', {
    connection : 'Fenster',
    colors     : ['#12693a', ...] // or [{"r":18,"g":105,"b":58}, ...]
});
response => {
    // [[{"r":18,"g":105,"b":58},{"r":18,"g":105,"b":58}, ...], ..]
