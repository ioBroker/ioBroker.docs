Based on [wetty](https://github.com/krishnasrinivas/wetty).

Wetty = Web + tty. Terminal access in browser over http/https

wetty server to open command line interface.
Please use it only for administration purposes.

Terminal over HTTP and HTTPS. Wetty is an alternative to ajaxterm/anyterm but much better than them because wetty uses
ChromeOS' terminal emulator (hterm) which is a full fledged implementation of terminal emulation written entirely in Javascript.
Also it uses websockets instead of Ajax and hence better response time.
