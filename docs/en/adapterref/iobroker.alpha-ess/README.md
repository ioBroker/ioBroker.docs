This adapter logs into the web API of [Alpha-ESS](https://www.alphaess.com/) and retrieves information for your Alpha-ESS equipment.\
Depending on your Alpha-ESS product, it is possible to get realtime data and configuration data for your equipment. Which data points are returned by the API depends on your Alpha-ESS equipment.

This adapter uses the Alpha-ESS Open API, which is an official and documented API for Alpha-ESS devices.

The quality attribute of each state is set accordingly to its status:
| Quality | meaning |
|:--------|:--------------------------------------------------|
|0x00 |OK and up to date |
|0x01 |value not updated due to unknown reason, see debug log |
|0x02 |problem with online connection for this data point |
|0x12 |adapter disconnected or stopped |
|0x44 |API returned error or internal error, see debug log |

## Settings:

To be able to use the Alpha-ESS Open API, you have to register your Alpha-ESS device unter https://open.alphaess.com. Once registered, you get a developer ID and a developer key (called "Secret"). You will need these to have access to the Open API.
How to find SN and Check code for registration is described here: https://github.com/alphaess-developer/alphacloud_open_api

- **Personal application ID:** The application ID (see above)
- **Personal application Secret:** The application Secret (see above)
- **Alpha-ESS System ID:** The S/N (serial number) of your Alpha-ESS equipment
- **Interval to read realtime data:** Unit: seconds.
- **Interval to read energy data:** Unit: minutes.
- **Interval to read charging settings:** Unit: minutes.
- **Interval to read discharging settings:** Unit: minutes.
- **Interval to read summary data:** Unit: minutes.
- **Interval to read wallbox data:** Unit: minutes. Caution: Currently only one Wallbox is supported.
- **Update unchanged states:** If this option is checked, states are changed even if the corresponding value is unchanged.
