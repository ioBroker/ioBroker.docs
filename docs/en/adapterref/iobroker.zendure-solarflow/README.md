## Zendure Solarflow adapter for ioBroker

This project is an ioBroker Adapter to read data from the Zendure Solarflow Cloud API. It uses the official API provided by Zendure.
You can read more about the API here: https://github.com/Zendure/developer-device-data-report

## Features

- Get all telemetry data from your Solarflow devices, also those not visible in the offical app - like battery voltage
- Control your Solarflow HUB like in the offical app. Most of the settings are available.
- Control the output limit - you are not limited to use a Shelly Pro EM to realize a zero feed-in. You can also design more complex scenarios via script or blockly in ioBroker.
- Stop input if one battery drops into low voltage (battery protect). Works only when setting the output limit via the adapter
- Control more than one Solarflow at the same time!
- Get more precise calculations!
- Works with all Zendure SolarFlow devices: HUB1200 (tested), HUB2000 and AIO (both untested)!

## Notes

1. Please deactivate/uncheck all modes in the Zendure App, otherwise it is not possible to set the output limit!

   ![Solarflow Settings Window](https://raw.github.com/nograx/ioBroker.zendure-solarflow/master/Screenshots/ZendureSolarflowSettings.png)

2. You will be logged out of the official iOS or Android App after logging in with the ioBroker adapter. This is a normal behavior. As a workaround you can create an second Zendure account with another e-mail and grant access to your Solarflow HUB to this account. Then use the second account for ioBroker / the Zendure Solarflow adapter.
