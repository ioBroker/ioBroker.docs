## Zendure Solarflow adapter for ioBroker

This project is an ioBroker Adapter to read data from the Zendure Solarflow Cloud API.

## Donate

If you find the adapter useful for you and want to support my work, feel free to donate by Paypal. Thank You!

## Features

- Get all telemetry data from your Solarflow devices, also those not visible in the offical app - like battery voltage
- Control your Solarflow HUB like in the offical app. Most of the settings are available.
- Control the output limit - you are not limited to use a Shelly Pro EM to realize a zero feed-in. You can also design more complex scenarios via script or blockly in ioBroker.
- Stop input if one battery drops into low voltage (battery protect). Works only when setting the output limit via the adapter
- Control more than one Solarflow at the same time!
- Get more precise calculations!
- Works with all Zendure SolarFlow devices: HUB1200, Hyper2000, HUB2000 and AIO!

## Offline-Mode (Disconnect from Zendure Cloud)

As a new feature you can disconnect the Zendure device from the Cloud. You can either use the [Solarflow Bluetooth Manager](https://github.com/reinhard-brandstaedter/solarflow-bt-manager) from Reinhard Brandst√§tter or my own Windows Tool [Zendure Cloud Disconnector](https://github.com/nograx/zendure-cloud-disconnector) to disconnect the device from the cloud. It's also possible to redirect DNS requests with your router from "mq.zen-iot.com" to your own MQTT server!

Both tools connect to the Zendure device via bluetooth and simply sets the internal MQTT url to a new url/ip you have to provide. Currently you are forced to use the default MQTT port 1883 on your server. You are also forced to deactivate authentication on the MQTT server as the Zendure device use a hardcoded password.

If the Zendure device communicates with your MQTT server, you can connect this ioBroker adapter to the same MQTT instance. You have to provide the device model and the device key (which is shown in the Zendure Cloud Disconnector app).

You can still do firmware updates with the official Zendure app via bluetooth and use both bluetooth tools to reconnect the device to the cloud!

## Important

If you plan to control the charging and feed in of your device with a script/blockly, I recommend using the control parameter '**setDeviceAutomationInOutLimit**', as this controls the device without writing to the flash memory of the device. It is also a good idea to set the control state '**smartMode**' to true if you own a HUB 1200/2000 with ACE 1500, as it will also force the device to write 'acMode' changes to the ram instead of flash memory.

### Hyper 2000, SF 2400 AC oder SF 800 (pro)

On devices like the Hyper 2000, SF 2400 AC oder SF 800 (pro) you can use negative values to trigger charging from grid. SF 2400 AC oder SF 800 (pro) is currently **untested**!

### HUB 1200 / HUB 2000 / ACE 1500 Combo

On a HUB 1200 / HUB 2000 / ACE 1500 combination you have to use '**setDeviceAutomationInOutLimit**' for feed in and manualy switch acMode and the '**setInputLimit**' if you want to charge from the grid. Setting the '**smartMode**' to true is highly recommended in this scenario!

## Notes

This adapter will now use the Cloud Authorization Code for authentication on the official mqtt servers, which you can generate in the Zendure app!

## Changelog
### 3.0.1 (2025-10-02)

- Update 'lastUpdate' when a battery value changes
- Add deviceKey 'R3mn8U' for Solarflow 800 Pro

### 3.0.0 (2025-09-30)

- Breaking Change: Change authentication to "authentication cloud key". You can generate a key in the official zendure app
- Removed fallback server
- Add deviceKey 'a4ss5P' for Solarflow 800
- Refactor a lot of code

### 2.0.4 (2025-09-12)

- Fix creation of control states on new Hyper 2000 v3
- Updates dependencies

### 2.0.3 (2025-09-09)

- Added 'B3Dxda' as new Hyper 2000 productKey
- Removed parameter 'upTime' and 'pullTime' from 'setDeviceAutomationInOutLimit'
- TEST: Use 'setDeviceAutomationInOutLimit' to let HUB1200/HUB2000 charge with connected ACE 1500

### 2.0.1 (2025-07-22)

- Small fix MQTT service

### 2.0.0 (2025-07-21)

- Breaking Change: Add control parameter 'setDeviceAutomationInOutLimit' which emulates Zendure's Smart Matching mode. I recommend using this device automation instead of 'setInputLimit'/'setOutputLimit' from now on, as there were concerns that setting limits/modes would be stored in the flash memory. You can use negative values for charging and positive for feed in. On HUB 1200/2000 with ACE 1500 you can use "smartMode" to prevent switching AC mode trigger writing to the flash memory. Check you the readme for more details or participate in the ioBroker forum.

### 1.15.4 (2025-07-17)

- Add smart mode control parameter for more devices

### 1.15.3 (2025-07-17)

- Match case sensitive product key for SF 2400 AC and SF 800 in settings if local mode is used
- Add sensor and control of "SmartMode"

### 1.15.2 (2025-07-14)

- Fix missing SF 800 & 2400 AC in local mode settings

### 1.15.1 (2025-07-11)

- Fix missing Solar Input 3 & 4 on Solarflow 800 Pro
- Fix 'packPower' state did not set to 0 if no input/output

### 1.15.0 (2025-06-27)

- Add 'packPower' state, which shows combined power from (packInputPower and outputPackPower). Discharging will be shown with a negative value.
- Add 'hyperTmp' to Solarflow 800 devices in hope this will show the temperature of the Solarflow 800 (can not test it due to lack of test device).
