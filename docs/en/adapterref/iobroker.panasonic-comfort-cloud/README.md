## panasonic-comfort-cloud adapter for ioBroker

Adapter to control devices in the Panasonic Comfort Cloud. It uses REST calls which are extracetd from the official Comfort Cloud app.
To use the a adpter you need to enter your username and password in the configuration. They are used to authenticate access to the Comfort Cloud. Information of all devices is automatically retrieved and inserted as an object. The adpter polls the device information cyclically (see interval in the settings) and sends commands directly to the cloud.

With the method used, only one client can be logged on with the account at a time.
It is recommended that a second account, for which the devices have been shared, is used.
