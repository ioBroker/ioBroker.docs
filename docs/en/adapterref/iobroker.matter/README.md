**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.**
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)!
Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Introduction
> [!Important]
> The adapter can NOT be installed via GitHub: The adapter must be installed via the ioBroker repository (stable or latest).
> 
> Currently the adapter is in the BETA phase and only available in latest repository. Please check [iobroker documentation](https://www.iobroker.net/#de/documentation/basics/repositories.md) how to install an adapter from latest repository/npm.
>
> A detailed description of the configuration and use of the ioBroker Matter adapter is described in the ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª [german Wiki](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.matter/wiki) and ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ [english Wiki](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.matter/wiki/Home-%E2%80%90-EN).
> 
> Please read the [Important notes](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.matter/wiki/Einleitung-und-wichtige-Hinweise#wichtige-hinweise-bitte-dringend-beachten) before using the adapter.

## Description
With the ioBroker Matter Adapter, it is possible to map the following use cases:
* Matter-based devices can be linked directly to ioBroker and thus read in / controlled
* The provision of multiple ioBroker devices as a Matter Bridge: Matter Bridges can contain multiple devices and are the easiest way to integrate ioBroker devices into a Matter-compatible ecosystem.
* ioBroker provides individual virtual Matter devices based on ioBroker devices / ioBroker states, which can be taught to a Matter-compatible ecosystem (currently only bridges are possible for Amazon Alexa)

## ToDo
* Texts are partially in english
* Sync min/max from Matter into ioBroker objects
* Cleanup objects when devices/states are removed
* ioBroker device types
  * (3+) vacuumCleaner
  * (3) volume, volumeGroup
  * (-3) airCondition
  * (2+) fireAlarm
  * (-2) mediaPlayer
  * warning - how?
  * gate - aka blinds because matter has no other device type?
  * windowTilt - as discussed as composed device with two contact sensors ... one for open close and one for tilt
  * levelSlider - ideally as non-lighting dimmed socket?
* Matter device types
  * (7) Fan -> airCondition?
  * (4+) Air Quality Sensor -> ???
  * (4+) Air Purifier -> ???
