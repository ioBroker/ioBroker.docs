## pjlink adapter for ioBroker

PJLink Projector controll

**!! For now only class 1 protocol is supported**

## About PJLink

> PJLink is a unified standard for operating and controlling data projectors.
PJLink enables central control of projectors manufactured by different vendors and projectors can be operated by a controller.
PJLink compliant equipment can be managed and controlled at any time and in any place, regardless of manufacturer.
PJLink is a new standard designed to make communication interfaces and communication protocols that have been different from one projector manufacturer to another uniform and common.

> PJLink compliant equipment features a high interconnectivity across different models and manufacturers, enabling easy construction of environments that are mixed with different models and systems and easy replacement of systems that are already in place.

This work is based on the nodejs module with pjlink implementation from **sy1vain**:
[https://github.com/sy1vain/node-pjlink](https://github.com/sy1vain/node-pjlink)

## ToDo
* support the node-pjlink project to implement class 2
* go back to the pjlink library on github. For now the library is held localy because of an error in the test script

## How the adapter works
For now only class 1 is supported. This means the adapter can only poll the status.
Active sending from status information from the device to the adapter can be
added as soon as class 2 is supported.

#### PJLink Class 1 inputs

* The inputs must be set as 2-digit numbers. The first digit describes the input type

| Type    | Number | possible Inputs |
| ------- | ------ | --------------- |
| RGB     | 1      | 1 - 9 |
| VIDEO   | 2      | 1 - 9 |
| DIGITAL | 3      | 1 - 9 |
| STORAGE | 4      | 1 - 9 |
| NETWORK | 5      | 1 - 9 |

The possible inputs can be found in the database after the adapter has been started under
> pjlink.\<instance\>.deviceInfo.availableInputs

You can edit the input object in the instance configuration. There you can edit the names of the inputs and
let the database object validate your inputs.

### Power Switch
With the state (set to **true**)

> pjlink.\<instance\>.power

the projector can be switched on **and** off depending on the current power state.

> pjlink.\<instance\>.powerStatus

The power switch will automatically return to **false**.

#### Lamp status
Only one lamp ist predefined in the database. If the lamp query returns more than one lamp,
the other lamps will be added dynamically.

#### ping feature
If the projector is not reachable for a longer period the adapter can switch to
icmp ping to check the reachability, e.g after 3 failed connects. If one ping is answered the adapter tries to reconnect again,
