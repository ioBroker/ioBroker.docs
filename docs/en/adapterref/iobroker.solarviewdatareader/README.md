## solarviewdatareader adapter for ioBroker

The adapter reads the data from the Solarview data logger.
Here you can find additional infos about Solarview: https://www.solarview.info/solarlogger.aspx


## Configuration

### IP address, Port
To get the data from the datalogger you must enter the ip-address and the port from your solarview TCP server. 
The standard port is 15000. Please refer to the Solarview documentation https://www.solarview.info/solarlogger.aspx.

### D0 converter
If you have a D0 converter connected to the Solarview data logger you can enable this option.
For questions please refer to the Solarview documentation.

### Self consumption meter sum and 1 to 4
If you have a S0 meter, you can enable this option. 
You can have up to 4 self consumption meters and the sum from all meters.
For questions please refer to the Solarview documentation.

### Inverter 1 to 4
Every inverter you can enable separately.
For questions please refer to the Solarview documentation.

### Interval, interval start, interval end
Here you can configure the time range and the interval. The time range for 24h is 00:00 to 23:59.
Not 00:00 to 00:00.

### Set system variable CCU, System variable
This ist a special feature for the homematic CCU. You can define a system variable in the CCU.
In this system variable the actual PAC value is saved.
You have to fill in the ioBroker state for that system variable -> **e.g. "hm-rega.0.12345"**

### Created states
#### pvig, pvi1..4, d0supply, d0consumption
daily = daily yield (kWh)
montly = monthly yield (kWh)
yearly = yearly yield (kWh)
total = total yield (kWh)
current = generator power in W
UDC, UDCB, UDCC, UDCD = generator voltages in volt per MPP-Tracker
IDC, IDCB, IDCC, IDCD = generator current in ampere per MPP-Tracker
UL1, IL1 = mains voltage, mains power phase 1
UL2, IL2 = mains voltage, mains power phase 2
UL3, IL3 = mains voltage, mains power phase 3
TKK= Temperature inverter
