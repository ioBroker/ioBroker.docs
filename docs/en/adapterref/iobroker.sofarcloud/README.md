## sofarcloud adapter for ioBroker

This adapter reads the data from the SofarCloud server and stores it in the data point sofarcloud.

The SofarCloud server stores data from Sofar inverters.

First, install the app ( https://de.sofarsolar.com/cloud.html ) and register your Sofar inverter.

You must then enter your login details in the adapter (email & password).

The data can be sent to another system via MQTT if desired.

The received data can also be saved as JSON (sofar_realtime.json).
