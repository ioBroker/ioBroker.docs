## Settings
### APP-KEY
To use cloud adapter you should first get the APP-Key on [https://iobroker.net](https://iobroker.net).

This is application key that the user can get on [https://iobroker.net](https://iobroker.net) site. Please get the key there and enter it here.

### Instance
All requests from cloud adapter will be routed to some WEB Instance. User must specify here the WEB instance, that will be showed to user, when he logs in https://iobroker.net site.

### Allow self-signed certificates
If you use standard iobroker.net cloud, you can deactivate it. This option is only important if own cloud used.

### Alexa settings
***Alexa is not supported in `cloud` adapter anymore. Use ioBroker.iot adapter for that.***

For some time it still will work for `.pro` users and the documentation is available [here](doc/alexa.md).

## IFTTT
[instructions](doc/ifttt.md)

## Services
There is a possibility to send messages to cloud adapter.
If you call ```[POST]https://iobroker.net/service/custom_<NAME>/<user-app-key>``` und value as payload.

```
curl --data "myString" https://iobroker.net/service/custom_test/<user-app-key>
```

If you set in the settings the field "White list for services" the name *custom_test*, and call with "custom_test" as the service name, the state **cloud.0.services.custom_test** will be set to *myString*.

You may write "*" in white list and all services will be allowed.

From version 2.0.5 you can use GET request in form ```[GET]https://iobroker.net/service/custom_<NAME>/<user-app-key>/<data>``` to place the **\<data\>** into **cloud.0.services.custom_\<NAME\>**.

Here you can find instructions how to use it with [tasker](doc/tasker.md).

IFTTT service is allowed only if IFTTT key is set.

Reserved names are "ifttt", "text2command", "simpleApi", "swagger". These must be used without the ```"custom_"``` prefix.

### text2command
You may write "text2command" in white list, you can send POST request to ```https://iobroker.net/service/text2command/<user-app-key>``` to write data into *text2command.X.text* variable.

"X" can be defined in settings by the "Use text2command instance" option.
