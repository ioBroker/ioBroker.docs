## vbus-gw adapter for ioBroker

Allows TCP access to serial port based VBus devices

This ioBroker Adapter is based on work by Daniel Wippermann.

## Overview

There are two types of VBus hardware adapters:

- TCP based: DL2, DL3, KM2, VBus/LAN
- Serial port based: VBus/USB, USB port of DeltaSol SLT and other controllers  

This ioBroker adapter connects to one or more serial port based hardware adapters and exposes them over TCP. This allows:

- transmitting VBus data over longer distances than USB or serial ports would normally permit
- accessing serial port based adapters from applications that only support TCP based ones

## Configuration

Configurable items are:

- The TCP port on which the service is listening for incoming connections.  
Default is port: 7053, which should not be changed.
- The http port on which the service is listening for discovery requests.  
Default is port: 80, alternatively port 3000 can be selected.
- The password of the VBus gateway.  
Allows access to all serial port connected VBus devices. Default is "vbus".  
- A list of serial ports to connect to with the following parameters for each serial port:  

- channel: The vbus channel to which the serial port is assigned.  
If you only want to connect to a single serial port it is recommended to configure that to use channel 0, since most applications will by default try and connect that channel 0.
- path: The path to the serial port like  
'/dev/ttyUSB0' or  
'/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_USB-Modul_UO2102_TDEB6I8DAVDLGAGC-if00-port0' or  
'/dev/serial/by-path/platform-fd500000.pcie-pci-0000:01:00.0-usb-0:1.4.1:1.0-port0' or  
'COM5'
- baudrate: The baudrate of the serial port. Default is 9600, which normally does not need to be changed.

## Known issues

- This adapter currently supports up to 3 VBus devices connected via serial ports.
- The passwords for all VBus'es connected to the serial ports are the same.  
- VBus.net connected devices are not emulated. Sending the CONNECT (via tag) command returns +OK although no connection is established.  
- Sending the DATA command with a non-existing channel selected returns +OK, but immediately closes the connection afterwards.
