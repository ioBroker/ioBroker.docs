## fuelpricemonitor adapter for ioBroker
This adapter retrieves the fuel (Diesel, Super95 and CNG) prices from the offical Austria database based on your configered geo-position. The API delivers the prices only for the first 5 station. For the other 5 stations the prices are not available. Additional locations can be added.
Default schedule is done every 20 minutes as cron job in the instance tab.  

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)!
