# ioBroker.ds18b20

The adapter `ds18b20` enables the direct integration of 1-wire temperature sensors of the type DS18B20 into ioBroker.

An appropriate hardware with support for the 1-wire bus is required (e.g. Raspberry Pi). Also the 1-wire bus must be properly functional on the system (sensors listed in `/sys/bus/w1/devices/`).


An example of the connection of DS18B20 sensors to a Raspberry Pi can be found below.


## Features

* Read the current temperature value
* Auto detect of the connected sensors
* Detection of errors while reading a sensor (checksum, communication error, device disconnected)
* Query interval customizable per sensor
* Rundung und Umrechnung des gemessenen Wertes pro Sensor anpassbar
* Rounding and conversion of the measured value customizable per sensor

## Installation

The adapter is currently available in the latest repository.

Alternatively, it be installed using the URL `https://github.com/crycode-de/ioBroker.ds18b20.git`.


## Configuration

In the adapter configuration, a **Default query interval** can be specified in milliseconds for all sensors. Minimum is 500.

The sensors can be added to a table manually or by **Search Sensors**.

![Konfiguration](./img/config.png)

The **Address** is the 1-wire address/ID of the sensor and determines the object ID.
As an example, a sensor with the address `28-0000077ba131` gets the object ID `ds18b20.0.sensors.28-0000077ba131`.

The **Name** is used to identity the sensor. It's freely selectable by you.

For each sensor a custom **Query interval** may be specified in milliseconds.
If this field is left blank, the default query interval will be used.
Minimum is 500.

The **Unit** defines the stored unit in the ioBroker object for the value.
Default is `°C`.

Via **Factor** and **Offset** it is possible to adjust the value read by the sensor according to the formula `value = (value * factor) + offset`.

The **Decimals** indicate how many places after the decimal point the value is rounded.
The rounding takes place after the calculation with factor and offset.

**Null on error** defines how sensor read errors are handled.
If this option is set, a `null` value be written to the sensor state on error.
If unset, the state will not be updated on errors.


### Conversion from `°C` to `°F`

To get the temperatures from the adapter in `°F` you need to use `1.8` as factor and `32` as offset.


## Actions

It is possible to trigger the instant reading of one or all sensors by writing to the state `ds18b20.0.actions.readNow`.

To trigger the reading of all sensors, write `all` to the state.

To tirgger the reading of a single sensor, write the address or ioBroker object ID of the sensor to the state.


## Using in scripts

It is possible to send commands to the adapter to read from the sensors or search for sensors.

### `readNow`

Using the commans `readNow` you can trigger the instant reading of one or all sensors.
To read all sensors, the message part can be empty or set to the string `all`.
To read a single sensor, the message part must be set to the address or ioBroker object ID of the sensor.

The commant `readNow` returns no data. It will only trigger the reading of the sensors.

```js
sendTo('ds18b20.0', 'readNow');
sendTo('ds18b20.0', 'readNow', '28-0000077ba131');
```

### `read`

Via the command `read`, a single sensor can be read.
The message part must be set to the address or ioBroker object ID of the sensor.
The value can be processed by a callback function.

```js
sendTo('ds18b20.0', 'read', '28-0000077ba131', (ret) => {
    log('ret: ' + JSON.stringify(ret));
    if (ret.err) {
        log(ret.err, 'warn');
    }
});
```

### `search`

The `search` command will run a search for all currently connected 1-wire sensors.
The found addresses of sensors will be provided to a callback function.

```js
sendTo('ds18b20.0', 'search', {}, (ret) => {
    log('ret: ' + JSON.stringify(ret));
    if (ret.err) {
        log(ret.err, 'warn');
    } else {
        for (let s of ret.sensors) {
            log('Sensor: ' + s);
        }
    }
});
```


## Adapter information
Via the `ds18b20.*.info.connection` State, each adapter instance provides information on whether all configured sensors provide data.
If the last reading of all sensors was successful, this state is `true`.
As soon as one of the sensors has an error, this state is `false`.


## DS18B20 connected to a Raspberry Pi

The connection of DS18B20 temperature sensors to a Raspberry Pi is done as shown in the following figure.
Note that the pullup resistor must be connected to +3.3V instead of +5V, as this would damage the GPIO.
In this example the GPIO.04 (BCM) is used.

![DS18B20 Raspberry Pi](./img/raspi-ds18b20.png)

To activate the 1-Wire bus on the Raspberry Pi, add the following line in the file `/boot/config.txt` and then restart the Raspberry Pi.
```
dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=4
```

If everything works, the connected sensors will be visible under `/sys/bus/w1/devices/`.
```
$ ls -l /sys/bus/w1/devices/

```
