?> ***This is a wildcard*** . <br><br> Help with ioBroker and extend this article. Please note the [ioBroker style guide](community/styleguidedoc), so that the changes can be adopted more easily.

@@@ Here are exemplary **overarching** solutions (how to reach which goal the easiest) and How-Tos are collected.

* Tutorials for Homematic
* Tutorials for ESP (with MQQT)
* Tutorials for ...
* Logic things (statistics functions)
* Complex timings
* Analyze and solve performance problems
* ...

Suggestion: If it concerns only one adapter (except logic adapter), then the example / solution must be in the reference documentation of the respective adapter.

In the same way configuration examples could be collected from tested HW components.
