# Getting started to develop an Adapter for ioBroker

This guide provides a best-practice introduction for Adapter development on Linux.

It focusses on a recommended way to Adapter devolopment:

* setup your development environment
* create an empty Adapter
* develop your Adapter
* publish your Adapter
* further recommendations and informations like debugging, usefull tools, ...

## Requirements

Recommended requirement for this guide is a computer or a virtual machine running Linux.

The fastest way is to use a virtual machine with [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/) (part of Windows 10) or [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) on your normal computer and install [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Minimal installation is sufficient.

There are already a lot of guides therefor. Search the internet for

* "hyper-v ubuntu" or
* "virtual box ubuntu"

Of course it is also possible to use Windows or MacOS.

## Setup development environment

### Install NodeJS and NPM

An Ubuntu installation has no NodeJS and NPM installed.

To install, start "Terminal" and execute the following commands:

`sudo apt install curl`

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -`

`sudo apt install -y nodejs`

`sudo reboot`

### Install Git ###

Git, the command line utility for Git repositories, for example hosted at github.com is also required. For install start "Terminal" and execute the following command:

`sudo apt install git`

### Install Visual Studio Code ###

Next step is installation of the IDE VSCode from Microsoft. For installation run the following command in terminal:

`sudo snap install --classic code`

### Install ioBroker dev-server ###

Missing a full installation of ioBroker?
This is not necessary for development. There is a small version of ioBroker for development purpose, called [dev-server](https://github.com/ioBroker/dev-server) 

For installation execute the following command in terminal:

`sudo npm install --global @iobroker/dev-server`

## Create an empty Adapter ##

Now the installation of our complete development environment is finished and you are ready for developing your Adapter.

ioBroker provides a simple [Adapter creator](https://github.com/ioBroker/create-adapter).

Start Terminal and go to your favorite development directory, for example `/home/username/development`. Then execute the following command:

`npx @iobroker/create-adapter`

The Adapter Creator will ask a few questions. Answer these questions individually for your project. In brackets the answers for our example here:

* Name of your adapter in small letters ("simpleadapter")
* Title in admin ui in iobroker ("Simple")
* Short description ("Simple Adapter as Development Example")
* Keywords ("example")
* Contributors (Leave empty)
* Detail level ("Specify everything")
* Features of project, Adapter, Visualization, or both ("Adapter")
* Additional features in configuration site in Admin UI (Leave empty)
* Category of Adapter ("Miscellaneous utilities")
* Adapter start ("always")
* Data source ("Website or cloud service")
* Data receiving ("request it regularly from the service or device")
* Indicate connection state ("No")
* Language ("Javascript")
* Use React for Admin UI ("No")
* Tools (Leave ESLint and type checking active)
* Tab or spaces ("Tab")
* Double or single quotes ("double")
* Structure of main adapter file ("As an ES6 class")

Afterwards there are some administrative details asked:

* Name
* Name on GitHub
* Mailaddress
* Protocol ("https")
* Initialize GitHub repo ("no")
* License of your Adapter ("MIT License")
* Continous integration service ("GitHub Actions")
* Regular dependency updates ("yes")

Finally, a empty Adapter with the specified details was created.

So change the directory with `cd ioBroker.simpleadapter` and start VSCode by `code .`

On first run of VSCode for a project, VSCode will ask to install the recommended extensions. Choose "Install".

For dev-server a setup must be executed. So start the Terminal in VSCode (Menubar "Terminal", "Start new Terminal"). Enter in the VSCode Terminal `dev-server setup`

Finally, we can run our very simple Adapter
* enter in the VSCode Terminal `dev-server watch`
* use a web browser to navigate to http://localhost:8081
* Go to "Log" and watch the output of "simpleadapter.0"

Here we go!

## Develop your Adapter

Now we have a complete development environment with a new Adapter.
But this Adapter has no functionallity yet, so let's start with development.

## Publish your Adapter

GIT, NPM, Adapter checker, Repo

## Further recommendations

Debug, Weblate, release-script, sentry
