#### The idea is now a collection of self-contained short tutorials for closed subject areas, target group-oriented for beginners (and advanced users). The tutorials here should build on each other.
Tutorials possibly also as videos.

#### Idea was once
Introduce a common thread through a sample project tutorial here.

After completing the tutorial, the user should have created a small example project that works everywhere, which includes adapter installation, configuration, mini-scripting and mini-visualization as well as history with diagram display.

Always refer to the "Configuration" chapter for more details.
