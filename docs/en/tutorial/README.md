#### Idea is now collection of self-contained short tutorials for completed topics, target group oriented for beginners (and advanced). The tutorials here are supposed to build on each other.
Tutorials possibly also as videos.

#### Idea was once
Introducing Red Thread through a sample project tutorial here.

After completing the tutorial, the user should have created a small example project that works everywhere, including adapter installation, configuration, mini-scripting and mini-visualization as well as a history with diagram display.

Again and again refer to the chapter "Configuration" for more details.
