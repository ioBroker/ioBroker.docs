#### The idea is now to create a collection of self-contained short tutorials for specific subject areas, aimed at beginners (and advanced users). The tutorials here should build on each other.
Tutorials possibly also as videos.

#### Idea was once
Red thread through an example project tutorial here.

After completing the tutorial, the user should have created a small example project that works everywhere and includes adapter installation, configuration, mini-scripting and mini-visualization as well as historization with diagram representation.

Always refer to the "Configuration" chapter for more details.
