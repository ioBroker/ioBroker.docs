# How to enable latest repository
Often the people will be asked to test the versions, that are not visible in the repository.
Very probably it is going about latest versions of adapters.

We do not suggest to use for non-advanced users the latest versions of adapters, because they may consist errors and may be rollback will be required.

Anyway the latest version could be installed as following:
- In System settings select the latest repository.

- After refresh on the adapter list, the newest version will be visible.
